int6kecho(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   int6kecho(7)

NAME
       int6kecho - Qualcomm Atheros Loopback Utility

SYNOPSIS
       int6kecho [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Send  an  Ethernet frame to some Qualcomm Atheros powerline device, using the VS_FR_LBK message, and instruct that device
       to echo that frame once per second for a given period of time. The VS_FR_LBK message is intended for diagnostic  purposes
       and  has  no  practical  application in an operational environment. Users must sign a formal non-diclosure agreement with
       Atheros before using this program.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the plc man page for  an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -f filename
              A frame description file. When this option is present, the named file is read, converted to binary format and used
              that the VS_FR_LBK message payload. It defines the Ethernet frame to be echoed by the  target  device.  The  frame
              will  be  padded to 60 bytes or truncated to 1038 bytes, as needed, to accommodate the VS_FR_LBK message. See efsu
              for more information on frame description files. If this option is omitted,  a  default  frame  or  pre-programmed
              frame is used.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppress normal progress and status messages. This option has no effect at this time.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. Specifically, this option prints incoming and outgoing frames in hexadeci‐
              mal format on stdout. Output can be directed to a text file for analysis.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of  some  powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address  is  local.  See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet  Media  Access  Control  (MAC)  addresses.  MAC  addresses  are  12  hexadecimal digits
       (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef) in upper, lower or mixed case. Individual octets may be separated by colons,  for  clarity,  but
       not  all  octets need to be seperated. For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether  local,  remote  or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for  the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local
              Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote and foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device
              at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros  HomePlug  AV  Vendor Specific Management Message Entry structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros,
       Ocala FL USA. Consequently, public information may not be available. Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to  modify  mes‐
       sage  structure and content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this pro‐
       gram.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sends the Ethernet frame defined in file abc.hex to powerline device 00:Bo:52:BA:BE:01. The  device
       will echo the frame about once per second for 5 seconds.

          # int6kecho -f abc.hex -d 5 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
