chknvm(7)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                      chknvm(7)

NAME
       chknvm - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Image File Validator

SYNOPSIS
       chknvm [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Validate  the image chain found inside a Qualcomm Atheros PLC firmware or parameter file by checking file structure, file
       size, image header sizes and checksums and image sizes and checksums.  Optionally, display internal image header informa‐
       tion  or information extracted from selected image types, when present.  Use this program to detect corrupted firmware or
       parameter files or inspect image files to determine content.

       This program handles both the older Thunderbolt and Lightning and the newer Panther and Lynx firmware file  formats.   It
       validates files directly from disk and so it is slower than program chknvm2 but needs less memory at runtime.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -i     Print revision string identity fields in fixed-width columns.  This option is useful when searching  .nvm  folders
              for a specific build.

       -m     Display  manifest content, if present.  The manifest is a special module, included in some image chains, that con‐
              tains useful information about the chain.  This option suppresses the summary ’looks good’ message.

       -r     Print firmware revision string on stdout.  This option suppresses the summary ’looks good’ message.

       -s     Print SDRAM configuration block on stdout.  This option automatically suppresses the summary ’looks good’ message.

       -q     Suppresses printing of routine messages.  Specifically, it suppresses the summary ’looks good’ message.

       -v     Print  additional  information such as the image header for each image processed.  This information can be used to
              distinguish one firmware file from another, if you know what to look for.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Atheros image file.  By convention, Atheros Image files have a .nvm file extension but this program
              does not enforce this convention.

DISCLAIMER
       Qualcomm  Atheros  firmware  file  structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently,
       public information is not available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to change firmware file structure or content or
       change  the  name or behavior of any program that inspects or changes firmware files, in future software releases without
       any obligation to notify or compensate users of such programs.

EXAMPLES
       This example reads file abc.nvm and validates it.  The message shown indicates that the file is the correct length, image
       headers  and  images  have the correct length and checksum and there are no read errors.  The file can be have either the
       newer or older format.

           # chknvm abc.nvm
           abc.nvm looks good

       The following example reads three files in succession and reports on each one.  You can suppress good news  with  the  -q
       option.

          # chknvm INT6400.nvm AR7400.nvm AR7420.nvm
          INT6400.nvm looks good
          AR7400.nvm looks good
          AR7420.nvm looks good

       This  next example displays the SDRAM parameter block found in the named files.  SDRAM parameter blocks are a legacy fea‐
       ture.  They were to configure memory.  Powerline device now run a  configuration  applet,  instead.   Observe  that  file
       AR6400.nvm us the only one that contains SDRAM parameters.

          # chknvm -s INT6400.nvm AR7400.nvm AR7420.nvm
          ------- INT6400.nvm (0) -------
                  SIZE=0x04000000 (64mb)
                  CONF=0x00143188
                  TIM0=0x01E1D491
                  TIM1=0x000883D6
                  CNTRL=0x00003089
                  REF=0x00000366
                  CLOCK=0x00000001

       This next example prints the firmware revision string found inside older image files.  The option can be used to identify
       the actual firmware image present when the filename has been changed.   Newer  image  files  have  a  manifest,  instead.
       Observe that file AR7420.nvm shows no firmware revision string because it has the newer image file format.

          # chknvm -r INT6400.nvm AR7400.nvm AR7420.nvm
          INT6400.nvm (3) INT6000-MAC-4-1-4122-01-4020-20100219-FINAL
          AR7400.nvm (5) INT7400-MAC-7-0-7011-01-52-20110811-FINAL

       This  example prints the manifest found inside newer firmware files.  This can be used to distinguish firmware files from
       parameter files, determine exact firmware or parameter file revisions and so forth.  Observe that  we  specified  several
       files on the command line but only one file, AR7420.nvm, contained a mainfest.

          # chknvm -m INT6400.nvm AR7400.nvm AR7420.nvm
