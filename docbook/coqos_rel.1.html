coqos_rel(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   coqos_rel(7)

NAME
       coqos_rel - Release Bandwidth Management

SYNOPSIS
       coqos_rel [options] cid [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This page is under construction.

       Instructs  one or more devices to stop managing a stream.  Use this program when bandwidth management is no longer needed
       or wanted.  Use program coqos_mod to suspend and resume bandwidth management of a stream.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -r     Display relative memory offsets on output.  This option is the default.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program  help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       cid    The connection identifier of the affected stream.

       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command line.  If more
              than one address is specified then operations are performed on each  device  in  turn.   The  default  address  is
              &quot;local&quot;.  See DEVICES for more information.

DEVICES
       Ethernet  MAC addresses are expressed as six hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.  For example, the Qualcomm
       Atheros Local Management Address (LMA) of &quot;00b052000001&quot; may also be entered as &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot;  or  &quot;00b052:000001&quot;.
       Addresses  are  case  insensitive  and  quotes  are optional.  In addition, some special addresses may be entered by name
       rather than number where names are case sensitive.

       all    A synonym for the &quot;broadcast&quot; address, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

EXAMPLES
       The  next  example instructs device 00:B0:52:BA:BE&quot;01 to release stream 803. The stream will the remain unmanaged indefi‐
       nitely.
