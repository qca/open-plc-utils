plcset(7)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                      plcset(7)

NAME
       plcset - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Set Property

SYNOPSIS
       plcset [options] [type data] [type data] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Set  a specific property value on an Qualcomm Atheros powerline device using the VS_SET_PROPERTY message.  Properties are
       specified using their numeric property identifier.  Property names are not supported.  Property values are entered  using
       type and data pairs.  Users familiar with program setpib should already understand this method of entering data values.

       Only  selected properties can be set using this message type.  See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Man‐
       ual for supported property identifiers, versions, values and data formats.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -n number
              The  property  identifier  or  peoperty  version.  Property identifiers and versions are entered as 32-bit decimal
              integers.  Property names are not supported.  The default is 0.  This option may appear more than once on the com‐
              mand  line.   The first occurance specifies the property identifier.  The second occurances specifies the property
              version.  See the Firmware Technical Reference Manual for an list of valid property identifiers and versions.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via  this
              interface  are  recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle network
              connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the  default  interface.
              This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -o option
              The  update  option  (or  method) expressed as an 8-bit hexadecimal integer.  The prefix &quot;0x&quot; is optional.  Option
              values are constructed from the logical OR of 0x01=ApplyNow, 0x02=Persist and 0x04=Reset.  The only  legal  option
              values are 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 and 0x06.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays  program  help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays program version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

FORMATS
       Each  property  is  assigned one or more values.  Each value may have a different type and size.  The expected type, size
       and order of property values is described in the Firmware Technical Reference Manual under  the  VS_SET_PROPERTY  message
       description.  Expected data types and values must be entered on the command line in the order specified in the manual and
       must appear on the command line before any device addresses appear.

       byte integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 8 bits or 1 byte.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A binary value may
              be  expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  The offset increments by
              1 prior to the next insertion.

       word integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 16 bits or 2 bytes.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A  binary  value
              may  be  expressed  with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  The result will be
              sent in little endian byte order.  The offset increments by 2 prior to the next insertion.

       long integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 32 bits or 4 bytes.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A  binary  value
              may  be  expressed  with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  The result will be
              sent in little endian byte order.  The offset increments by 4 prior to the next insertions.

       huge integer
              An unsigned integer stored as 64 bits or 8 bytes.  The value is expressed in decimal by default.  A  binary  value
              may be expressed with a 0b prefix.  A hexadecimal value may be expressed using a 0x prefix.  The offset increments
              by 8 prior to the next insertion.  The result will be sent in little endian byte order.  This type is only  avail‐
              able on hosts that support 64 bit data values.

       data hex
              A  sequence  of  hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number of octets deter‐
              mines the number of bytes written.  The result is sent in the byte order specified on the command line.  The  off‐
              set  increments  by  the  number  of bytes written.  This is similar to &quot;key&quot; and &quot;mac&quot; below but accepts variable
              length input.

       key hex
              A sequence of hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number of octets must con‐
              vert to 16 bytes or an error will occur.  The result is sent in the byte order specified on the command line.  The
              offset increments by 16 prior to the next insertion.  This is similar &quot;data&quot; above but accepts  ony  fixed  length
              input.  This option may be used to set the DAK, NMK or NVAK values.

       mac hex
              A sequence of hexadecimal octets.  Octets may be separated by a colon for clarity.  The number of octets must con‐
              vert to 6 bytes or an error will occur.  The result is sent in the byte order specified on the command line.   The
              offset  increments  by  6 prior to the next insertion.  This is similar &quot;data&quot; above but accepts only fixed length
              input.  This option may be used to set the DAK, NMK or NVAK values.

       hfid string
              An ASCII character string.  The string is always stored as 64 bytes.  Short strings are padded on the  right  with
              NUL  characters.   Long  strings are truncated on the right and the last byte is forced to NUL.  The offset incre‐
              ments by 64 prior to the next insertion.  This option may be used to enter user, network and  manufacturer identi‐
              fication strings.

       zero count
              An  unsigned integer representing the number of consecutive bytes to fill with 0x00.  The offset increments by the
              number of bytes written.  This option may be used to erase regions of the PIB.

       fill count
              An unsigned integer representing the number of consecutive bytes to fill with 0xFF.  The offset increments by  the
              number of bytes written.  This option may be used to erase regions of the PIB.

       skip count
              An  unsigned  integer indicating the number of bytes to skip over before staring another change.  Intervening data
              data locations are unchanged.

TR69 DATA TYPES
       These data types are not currently recognized by the runtime firmware and so errors will certainly  result  if  they  are
       used.

       accesspassword string
              An  ASCII character string.  The string is always stored as 257 bytes.  Short strings are padded on the right with

       username string
              An  ASCII character string.  The string is always stored as 257 bytes.  Short strings are padded on the right with
              NUL characters.  Long strings are truncated on the right and the last byte is forced to NUL.   The  offset  incre‐
              ments by 257 prior to the next insertion.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets the &quot;time-to-live&quot; property for each channel access priority type: CAP0, CAP1, CAP2, CAP3  and
       MME.  The property identifier is 101.  It needs five 32-bit decimal integer values in microseconds.  Data type long spec‐
       ifies a 32-bit decimal value that will be converted to little endian format on output.

          # plcset -n 101 long 100 long 200 long 250 long 300 long 100

       The next example set the User HFID.  The first occurance of option -n specifies the property by number as 105.  The  sec‐
       ond  occurance specifies the property version as 1.  This is merely an example of how to specify the propery version.  At
       the time of writing, property 105 is still version 0.
