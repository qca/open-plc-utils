config2cfg(7)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                  config2cfg(7)

NAME
       config2cfg - Atheros Configuration File Converter

SYNOPSIS
       config2cfg [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  config2cfg program converts an SDRAM configuration file used by the Windows Device Manager to the configuration file
       format used by the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       There are no options.

EXPLANATION
       The  Windows  Device Manager format consists of 64 ASCII hexadecomal characters.  Files usually have a .config extension.
       File size is at least 64 characters.  Excess characters are ignored in input.  This means  that  files  can  be  modified
       using  any text editor and there is no way to detect modification.  From a programmin standpoint, ASCII-to-binary conver‚Äê
       tion and checksum computation is required on input and binary-to-ASCII conversion iw required on output.

       The Atheros Powerline Toolkit format consists of 32 binary bytes plus a 4 byte (32 bit) checksum.  Files usually  have  a
       .cfg extension.  File size is always 36 characters.  The files can be edited using any hex editor but a new checksum must
       be computed and inserted after any change.  No conversion or computation is required on input or output.  Input is  ready
       for direct insertion into a VS_SET_SDRAM message.

       Programs  int6k  and  int6kf  expect this latter format and so you can use this program determine if a given file has the
       proper format.

OPTIONS
       file   The filename of a Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration file.  The file is re-written such that the  filename
              is  preserved  but  the contents are not.  Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration files usually have a .config
              extension but the program makes no assumption based on filename and does not enforce any filename conventions.

       -q     Suppresses printing of progress messages.  There are no progress messages in this version.

       -v     Print additional information.  There is no additional information printed in this version.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

EXAMPLES
       The following example reads file abc.cfg and validates it.  The message shown indicates that the  configuration  file  is
       the correct size and has a checksums and there are no read errors.

           &gt; chkcfg abc.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good

       The  following  example  reads three files in succession and reports on each one.  You can suppress good news with the -q
       option.

           # chkcfg abc.cfg def.cfg ghi.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
           chkcfg: def.cfg is corrupt
           chkcfg: ghi.cfg looks good

       The following example displays the SDRAM configuration values in all files having names that match the  wildcard  pattern
       sdram*.cfg.   We can confirm that the values inside are correct for their filenames.  Program output could have been sent
       to a file and saved for later reference.

           # chknvm -qv sdram*.cfg
           ------- sdram32.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x02000000 (32mb)
                   CONF=0x00143188
                   TIM0=0x01E1D491
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000366
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
           ------- sdram16.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x01000000 (16mb)
                   CONF=0x00142F68
                   TIM0=0x0115124E
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000493
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
