edsu(7)                                        Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                        edsu(7)

NAME
       edsu - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet II Data Send Utility

SYNOPSIS
       edsu [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Send  one  or more files as a series of Ethernet II (IEEE 802.2) frames.  Input files are sequentially read and sent over
       network as a continuous stream of standard Ethernet frames.  All frames (except perhaps the last  frame  for  each  file)
       will contain 1500 bytes of file data.  The receiving host may elect to concatenate frame data as frames arrive.

       This program can be used to test remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline devices.  The remote UART-enabled powerline device
       will remove frame headers and forward frame data to the local host as a serial data stream.  No protocol  is  imposed  on
       the  serial  data stream.  For example, there is no indication of frame or file start or end within the stream.  The ret‐
       mote powerline device must be in Transparent Mode and configured to accept frames from the sending host.  The remote host
       must also be ready to handle serial data as it arrives.

OPTIONS
       -d xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              The  Ethernet  address  of  the destination device.  If the destination device is a Linux, Mac OSX or Windows host
              then program edru can be used to receive and write frame data to stdout as a serial stream.   If  the  destination
              device  is  an  Atheros  UART-enabled powerline device then received frame data will be converted to a serial data
              stream and forwared to the host connected to that device.  In that case, the UART-enabled powerline device must be
              programmed with the address of the sending host.

       -e ethertype
              The protocol (or ethertype) of interest expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal integer.  Prefix &quot;0x&quot; is optional.  This
              filters out frames having any other ethertype.  The default is ETH_P_802_2 as defined in if_ether.h.

       -i interface
              The host interface used to send frames.  The program default is &quot;eth1&quot; on Linux, &quot;en0&quot; on MacOSX  or  OpenBSD  and
              &quot;2&quot;  on  Windows; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined, it supersedes the program default.  Any  inter‐
              face specified on the command line supersedes all others.

       -p seconds
              Pause time in seconds between sending each frame.  Pauses may be necessary when the destination device is a  UART-
              enabled  powerline  device because each frame must be converted and transmitted serially from the remote device to
              the remote host.  Permitted pause times are 0 through 255 seconds.  The default is 0.

       -q     Quiet mode.  This option has no effect at this time.

       -v     Verbose mode.  This option displays outgoing frames on stdout in hexadecimal dump format as they are sent.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of a text or binary file accessible from the local host.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  sends  files  abc.txt  then  def.bin  to  the  remote  Atheros  UART-enabled  powerline   device
       00:B0:52:BA:BE:55 over network interface eth1.  There is a constant 1 second delay between each frame sent so that remote
       UART-enabled powerline devices have time to convert and forward each frame to their local host.

          # edsu -ieth1 -d 00:b0:52:BA:BE:55 abc.txt def.bin
