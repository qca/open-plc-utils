plcsnif(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     plcsnif(7)

NAME
       plcsnif - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 Powerline Traffic Sniffer

SYNOPSIS
       plcsnif [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Enable  or  disable  powerline  packet sniffing on the local powerline device. Special PIB settings are required for this
       feature to work and special tools are required to interpret the output. This program is  not  for  general  Atheros  cus‐
       tomers.

       This  program  is  part  of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the APT man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       Enabling the sniffer mode on Atheros Powerline Devices will introduce high processor overheads on the  device  and  flood
       the  local  Ethernet  subnet  with traffic destined for the local host. This may affect both local Ethernet and powerline
       data rates. Do not enable sniffer mode on powerline devices connected to operational powerline or Ethernet networks reck‐
       lessly.

OPTIONS
       -d     Dump  sniffer  data  on  the  console.  Sniffer data is printed as one or more hexadecimal fields seperated by one
              space. The first field is direction displayed as two hex digits. The next field is powerline  device  system  time
              displayed  as  16 hex digits. The next field is powerline beacon time displayed as 8 hex digits. The next field is
              frame control displayed as 32 hex digits. The last field is the beacon body displayed as 272 hex digits.

       -m mode
              Enable, disable or inspect the powerline packet sniffer mode on the local powerline device. Valid modes are 0=off,
              1=on and 2=inspect.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses normal progress and status messages.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command  line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If more  than  one
              address  is  specified  then  operations  are  performed on each device in turn. The default address is local. See
              DEVICES for information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet hardware addresses. Hardware addresses are 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or  mixed
       case.  Individual  octets  may be separated by colons, for clarity, but not all octets need to be seperated. For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following addresses are special and may be expressed by name instead of number.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether  local,  remote  or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for  the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local
              Atheros devices will recognize this address but remote and foreign devices will not. A remote device is any device
              at the far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL
       USA. Consequently, public information is not available. Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify  message  structure
       or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

       This  program  is provided for engineering purposes only and is not required for normal powerline device operation. Qual‐
       comm Atheros shall not be responsible for any adverse consequences resulting from the use of this program  in  an  opera‐
       tional environment by anyone for any reason.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  enables  the sniffer mode on all local powerline devices connected to interface eth1 because the
       program default address is 00:B0:52:00:00:01. Remote powerline devices are not affected. If you only want to enable snif‐
       fer mode on one local powerline device then specify the address on the command line.

          # plcsnif -m 1 -i eth1
          eth1 00:07:CB:E0:00:68 SNIFFER ON
          eth1 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01 SNIFFER ON

       The  program  will return immediately but VS_SNIFFER.IND messages are continuously sent to the local host, in background,
       until the device is reset or the sniffer mode is diabled. You can use a packet sniffer, such as Wireshare, or run program
       HPAV or snif in another console window, to observe the messages. Be sure to select the correct Ethernet interface.

       The next example disables the sniffer mode on the local device 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01 connected to interface eth1.

          # plcsnif -i eth1 -m 0 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01
          eth1 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01 SNIFFER OFF

       The  following example queries local devices to report their sniffer state. Observe that each local device, in this case,
       is in a different state.

          # plcsnif -m 2 -i eth1
          eth1 00:07:CB:E0:00:68 SNIFFER ON
          eth1 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01 SNIFFER OFF

       The following example disables the sniffer state on all local powerline devices connected to interface  eth1.  The  local
       keyword is shorthand for 00:B0:52:00:00:001 as in the DEVICES section. It is the default device address.

          # plcsnif -m 0 -i eth1 local
          eth1 00:07:CB:E0:00:68 SNIFFER OFF
          eth1 00:B0:52:DA:DA:01 SNIFFER OFF

       The  following  example prints sniffer data on the console. The fields in this example are direction, system time, beacon
       time, frame control and beacon data. Observe that data is displayed in little-endian format.

          # plcsnif -d
