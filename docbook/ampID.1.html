ampID(7)                                       Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                       ampID(7)

NAME
       ampID - Echo Device Key

SYNOPSIS
       ampID [options] [device] [device] [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  prints  a single powerline device key or HFID on stdout.  It can be used to dynamically define environment
       variables or insert command line arguments in scripts at runtime.  It is intended to echo a specific key read from a sin‐
       gle  device  but  it  can be used to echo a specific key type read from several devices by specifying either the Qualcomm
       Atheros Local Management Address or a broadcast address.

       This program is, in some sense, the inverse of modpib but it reads the key and HFID directly from  the  powerline  device
       instead of reading from a PIB file.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -A     Prints the Ethernet address (MAC) for each specified device.  This option and options -D, -M, -N, -S  and  -U  are
              mutually exclusive.

       -D     Prints  the  Device Access Key (DAK) for each specified device.  This option and options -A, -M, -N, -S and -U are
              mutually exclusive.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -n     Append a newline to the end of each key.  Newlines are omitted by default so that program output can  be  used  as
              the raw input to another program.  If you want the newline then you must request it with this option.

       -M     Prints  the Network Membership Key (NMK) for each specified device.  This option and options -A, -D, -N, -S and -U
              are mutually exclusive.

       -N     Prints the network HFID string for each specified device.  This option and options -A, -D, -M, -S and -U are mutu‐
              ally exclusive.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -S     Prints  the manufacturer HFID string for each specified device.  This option and options -A, -D, -M, -N and -U are
              mutually exclusive.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -x     Cause  the  program  to  exit  on  the  first error instead of continuing with remaining iterations, operations or
              devices.  Normally, the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or  device  depending
              on the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.   See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is  any  device  at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following example prints the DAK of the local device on stdout.  The local device  is  interrogated  because  no  MAC
       address was specified.  The default interface, eth1 on Linux and 2 on Windows, is used unless environment variable PLC is
       defined.  The DAK is always printed by default.  Depending on your system, you may want to use option -n when using  this
       program interactively.

          # ampID
          00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:AA:DD:CC:DD:EE:FF

       The  following example prints the NMK of device 00:B0:52:DA:DA:57 connected to interface eth2 on a Linux system.  Several
       devices could be specified but that is not a common request.

          # DAK -Mi eth2 00:B0:52:DA:DA:57
          F4:23:71:4A:51:39:C2:2D:E5:EA:87:43:99:A1:37:81

       The following example dynamically inserts the DAK and NMK of the previous device on the command line of another  program.
       In  this  example, we want to insert the DAK and NMK into PIB file abc.pib using program modpib.  See the modpib man page
       for an explanation of command line syntax.  See the GNU bash manuals for an explanation of why this works.

          # modpib abc.pib -D $(ampID -Di eth2 00:B0:52:DA:DA:57) -N $(ampID -Mi eth2 00:B0:52:DA:DA:57)

       The following example is an alternate way of accomplishing the same thing using shell script variables.  This method  may
       be easier to read and maintain.  Notice that we ’squished’ all the options together for brevity.

          # PLC=00:B0:52:DA:DA:57
          # DAK=$(ampID -Dieth2 ${PLC})
          # NMK=$(ampID -Mieth2 ${PLC})
          # modpib abc.pib -D ${DAK} -N ${NMK}
