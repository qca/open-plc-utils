amprate(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     amprate(7)

NAME
       amprate - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 PHY Rate Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       amprate [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Atheros  PHY  Rate Utility polls one or more devices and prints the average transmit and receive PHY rates between a
       device and each neighboring network device.  Output is column-oriented and suitable for loading  into  a  spreadsheet  or
       being read by a simple program.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program version is identical to legacy program int6k, except for options -t and -T which use version 1 of the  Qual‐
       comm Atheros VS_NW_INFO vendor-specific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize this message version.

OPTIONS
       -c     Display  coded  PHY  rates.   Coded PHY rates are displayed by default so this option is redundant but it has been
              kept for backword compatibility.  This option and option -u are mutually exclusive.

       -d seconds
              Traffic duration in seconds per connection.  Directional traffic is systematically sent between each pair of  pow‐
              erline  network  devices for this period of time.  Consequently, the total time needed to generate traffic between
              all network devices will be approximately n! times this value, so don’’t get carried away.  The minimum value is 1
              second and the maximum value is 60 seconds.

       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -n     Reads  the  average  transmit and receive PHY rate for wach device using VS_NW_INFO and prints it on stdout.  Each
              output line displays the ethernet interface, source address,  destination  address  and  either  the  transmit  or
              receive PHY rate.

       -o milliseconds
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -q     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -r     Reads device hardware and software revision information using VS_SW_VER and prints it on stdout.

       -R     Resets the device using VS_RS_DEV.

       -t     Generate powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device on each powerline network connected  to
              the host.  It does not generate any traffic between remote powerline device pairs.  This option is especially use‐
              ful when remote powerline devices are not connected to Ethernet devices capable of sending  traffic  back  to  the
              host.

       -T     Generate  powerline  traffic  between all devices on each powerline network connected to the host.  This option is
              similar to option -t but it takes much longer because traffic is systematically generated  between  each  pair  of
              powerline  devices.  Consequently, the time to complete will increase factorially as the number of network devices
              increases.  Such complete traffic path coverage is not always needed.

       -u     Display un-coded PHY rates.  Coded PHY rates are displayed by default.  This option and  option  -c  are  mutually
              exclusive.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -x     Exit  program  on  first  error  with  a non-zero exit code.  This option allows shell scripts to detect failed or
              incomplete operations and take the appropriate action.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.  See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The following example displays the average transmit and receive PHY rates from each of  two  devices.   One  is  a  local
       device  connected to interface eth2 and the other is a remote device at the far end of the powerline.  In this case, they
       are the only two devices on the powerline network.  Observe the recipricol rates shown.

          # amprate -ni eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA TX 176 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:BB 00:B0:52:00:00:AA RX 163 mbps

       The following example generates powerline traffic between the local device and each remote device because  option  -t  is
       present.  It then displays the PHY rate read from the local device.

          # amprate -tni eth2
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB TX 163 mbps
          eth2 00:B0:52:00:00:AA 00:B0:52:00:00:BB RX 176 mbps
