ampstat(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     ampstat(7)

NAME
       ampstat - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 Link Statistics

SYNOPSIS
       ampstat [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  Atheros  Device Statistics Utility polls a device and prints network and link statistics in various formats suitable
       for use by other programs.  This is a work in progress so user feedback is encouraged.  Link statistics  are  only  valid
       between one powerline device and another.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program is identical to legacy program int6kstat but uses version 1 of the Qualcomm Atheros VS_NW_INFO Atheros  ven‐
       dor-specific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize this message version.

OPTIONS
       -C     Clear  device link statistics using VS_LNK_STATS.  Statistics are read and cleared then displayed.  The statistics
              that are read and displayed depend on options -d, -p and -s but all link statistics are cleared.

       -d direction
              Return statistics for the specified direction using VS_LNK_STATS.  Direction can be 0=tx, 1=rx,  2=both  or  &quot;rx&quot;,
              &quot;tx&quot; or &quot;both&quot;.

       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i     Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received  via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network connection; however, if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it  takes  precedence  over  the  default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -l count
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device specified.  Normally, you will repeat
              operations on one device only.

       -m     Displays network membership information, as seen by one device, using VS_NW_INFO.  Use option -t for complete net‐
              work topology seen by the local host.

       -p peernode
              Ethernet  hardware  address  of  the  peer  node for VS_LNK_STATS.  This option is required for all Link ID values
              except 0xFC.  The default is 00:00:00:00:00:00.

       -q     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -s linkid
              The Link ID for VS_LNK_STATS.  Link ID values range from 0 through 255 but not all  values  are  accepted  by  the
              device  firmware.   Values may be expressed in decimal, binary prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or hexadecimal prefixed by &quot;0x&quot;.
              Many valid values can be expressed by name.  Valid values are listed and explained under LINKID.  The default Link
              ID is 0xFC.

       -t     Display  network  topology  using VS_SW_VER and VS_NW_INFO messages.  This option is similar to option -m but pro‐
              vides complete network topology plus device hardware and firmware version.  Topology is  always  relative  to  the
              local  host,  or  local hosts if present.  Powerline devices that appear on the command line are not used for this
              operation.  Older QCA powerline devices may fail to respond to this this  option.   In  that  event,  use  program
              int6kstat or plcstat.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -w seconds
              Defines  the  number  of  seconds to wait before repeating command line options.  This option has no effect unless
              option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.  See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

LINKID
       0x00,CSMA-CAP0
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP0 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address  must  be  specified
              using option -p.

       0x01,CSMA-CAP1
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for CAP1 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must be specified
              using option -p.

       0x02,CSMA-CAP2
              Display CSMA statistics for CAP2 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address  must  be  specified
              using option -p.

       0x03,CSMA-CAP3
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for CAP3 traffic using a single peer node.  The peer node MAC address must be specified
              using option -p.

       0xF8,CSMA-PEER
              Display CSMA statistics for all traffic using a single  peer node.  The peer node MAC address  must  be  specified
              using option -p.

       0xFC,CSMA-ALL
              Display  CSMA  statistics  for all traffic with all peer nodes.  A peer node MAC address is not needed and will be
              ignored if provided.  This value is the default for option -s.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
