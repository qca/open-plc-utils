ampboot(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     ampboot(7)

NAME
       ampboot - Qualcomm Atheros AR7x00 Powerline Device Bootstrapper

SYNOPSIS
       ampboot [options] -N file -P file [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Download and start runtime firmware on a local powerline device when it is in bootloader mode.  A device remains in boot‐
       loader mode when it cannot load firmware from flash memory for some reason.  This can happen if the device has  no  flash
       memory  or  the flash memory is either blank or corrupted.  You can use this progrm to start a device or start the device
       and then, once runtime firmware starts, program flash memory.

       The bootloader only recognizes a subset of Atheros message types.   This  program  uses  that  subset  to  write  runtime
       firmware  and  parameters  into  SDRAM  then  start  firmware execution.  Optionally, it can proceed to download the same
       firmware and parameters again and commit them to flash memory.

       Starting a device is a three phase operation.  The first phase writes an SDRAM configuration program into  TCM  and  exe‐
       cutes it.  The second phase writes runtime firmware and parameters as images into SDRAM.  The third phase starts firmware
       execution.  Once the runtime firmware starts, the device is operational.

       Flashing a device is a two phase operation.  The first phase downloads runtime firmare and parameters under firmware con‐
       trol  into  scratch  buffers.   The  second phase instructs the firmware to write the scratch buffers to flash memory and
       reboot the device.  After flashing the device is self-sustaining.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects  stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding a second F here or another -F  anywhere
              on  the  command  line  will force-flash a blank or corrupted NVRAM.  Firmware loaded from NVRAM will treat force-
              flash as an error.  This option can be used to create factory settings but cannot be used to change them once cre‐
              ated.  Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that can be erased using a factory reset.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Read the named NVM file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are required.  Any  file  having  an
              invalid  NVM  file format will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions
              are enforced.

       -P filename
              Read the named PIB file and write it to the device.  This option and argument are required.  Any  file  having  an
              invalid  PIB  file format will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions
              are enforced.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -t milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  Ethernet  hardware  address  of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command
              line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in  turn.   The  default
              address is local.  as explained in the DEVICES section.

DEVICES
       Powerline  device  addresses are 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets may be separated
       by  colons,  for  clarity,  but  colons  are  not  required.   For  example,  &quot;00b052000001&quot;,   &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot;   and
       &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       A  local  device is any Atheros Powerline Device connected directly to a host Ethernet interface.  A remote device is any
       Atheros Powerline Device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any powerline device not manufac‐
       tured by Atheros.

       Common  device  addresses  have symbolic names that can be used in place of the actual address value.  The following sym‐
       bolic addresses are recognized by this program and most other toolkit programs.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              will respond to this address.

       local  A  synonym  for the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All local Atheros devices
              will respond to this address but remote and foreign devices will not.

EXAMPLES
       The  -N and -P options are always required.  Their order is not important.  Tne MAC address is not needed because devices
       default to address 00:B0:52:00:00:01 (the program default address) in bootloader mode.  Once  this  operation  completes,
       firmware is running in SDRAM but the NVRAM, if present, has not been programmed.  This operation is common for flash-less
       devices.  If we reset the device at this point then the device will return to bootloader mode.

          ampboot -N test.nvm -P test.pib
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.

       The next example does the same thing but performs the extra steps needed  to  program  NVRAM.   It  first  downloads  the
       firmware  image  from file test.nvm and the parameter block image from file test.pib using VS_WR_MEM then starts firmware
       execution using VS_ST_MAC.  Once runtime firmware has started, it downloads the same firmware image and  parameter  block
       image (again) using VS_WR_MOD and commits them to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.

          ampboot -N test.nvm -P test.pib -F
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write SDRAM Configuration
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write to device memory
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Start Firmware
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Started.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write MAC as module
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Write PIB as module
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Written.
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flash Device
          # eth0 00:B0:52:00:00:01 Flashed.
