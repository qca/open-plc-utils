int6khost(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   int6khost(7)

NAME
       int6khost - INT6300 Host Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       int6khost [options] -C file -N file -P file -n file -p file

DESCRIPTION
       The  INT6300 Host Emulator waits for VS_HST_ACTION.IND messages from a local device and services them as described in the
       INT6300 Technical Reference Manual.  It can be used to demonstrate or verify proper device/host  interaction  for  flash-
       less  devices.   This  program  is not production grade and will stop dead - like a bug! - when things go wrong.  Use the
       Qualcomm Atheros Embedded API for real-time, production-grade applications.

       Host emulation applies to flash-less device designs where a local host processor provides the  persistent  storage.   The
       local  host  can provide a wide range of intelligent storage functions for a device but this program offers one.  Options
       -C, -N and -P name existing files that store factory default  memory  configuration,  runtime  firmware  and  parameters,
       respectively.   Options  -n  and -p name scratch files that will store user firmware and parameters, respectively.This is
       similiar to the standard Atheros NVRAM scheme but still different.

       To use the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this program with the  correct  file‐
       names.   The  program  will  automatically  respond  to device requests to download memory configuration, firmware and/or
       parameters and upload firmware or and/or parameters under device control.  See the Qualcomm  Atheros  Firmware  Technical
       Reference Manual for more information.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -C filename
              Use this file to download memory configuration when requested by the local device.  The file must exist and have a
              valid configuration file format or it will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename
              conventions are enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -F[F]  Flash  NVRAM  once  downloaded  firmware  has  started.   The  same  firmware and PIB are downloaded, again, using
              VS_WR_MOD and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding a second F here or another -F  anywhere  on  the  command
              line  will perform a forced flash.  When no NVRAM is present, normal and force flash cause the device to upload to
              the host.  When blank or corrupted NVRAM is present, forced flash writes to NVRAM.  This operation will fail  when
              no NVRAM is present.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -N filename
              Use this file to download firmware when requested by the local device.  The file must exist and have a  valid  NVM
              file  format  or  it  will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are
              enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -n filename
              Use this file to store firmware uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but an error  will  occur
              if  it  cannot  be  created  or written.  If firmware is uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent firmware
              downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that case, the file specified  by  option  -N  is  used.
              This option and argument are optional.  If omitted then the default filename host.pib will be used.

       -P filename
              Use this file to download parameters when requested by the local device.  The file must exist and have a valid PIB
              file format or it will be rejected.  No assumptions are made based on filename and  no  filename  conventions  are
              enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option and argument are required.

       -p filename
              Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but an error will occur
              if it cannot be created or written.  Once parameters are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent  parame‐
              ter  downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that case, the file specified by option -P is used.
              This option and argument are optional.  If omitted then the default filename host.nvm will be used.

       -q     Suppress status messages on stderr.

       -t milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Print  additional  information  on  stdout.   In particular, this option will print incoming and outgoing Ethernet
              frames on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The following command starts the host emulator.  The -C, -N and -P options are  always  required.   Their  order  is  not
       important.
