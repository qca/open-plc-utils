WTSSR-M(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     WTSSR-M(7)

NAME
       weeder - Weeder Solid State Relay Controller for Atheros PTS

SYNOPSIS
       This  man page documents technical details about the the WTSSR-M Solid State Relay Module from Weeder Technology. Atheros
       uses two such modules to control a progammable attenuator in their Production Test System and provides the weeder program
       in  the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. The information provided here goes beyond the capabilities of the weeder pro‐
       gram and is independent of any particular application.

       Relay modules can be chained. One module can be connected to an RS-232 port on a host computer.  Another  module  can  be
       plugged  into  the first, a third into the second and so on. This allows multiple modules to be controlled via one serial
       port using text strings that address a specific device.

SWITCH SETTINGS
       Each Solid State Relay Module has a DIP switch that sets the module address. There are 16 possible DIP switch  configura‐
       tions. The first character of each command string is an ASCII letter that corresponds to one of these configurations and,
       consequently, a specific module.

ACTIONS
       Modules can perform the following actions. Each action has a corresponding command that is  described  in  the  following
       secion.

       CLOSE  Closes  the specified solid-state relay.  The relay can be instructed to remain closed until a further command, or
              open back up after a user defined time-out period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out  values,  use
              the SEQUENCE command. Note, if a time-out value is used, the communications port will be disabled until the timing
              function has completed.

       OPEN   Opens the specified solid-state relay.  The relay can be instructed to remain open until  a  further  command,  or
              close  back up after a user defined time-out period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use
              the SEQUENCE command. Note, if a time-out value is used, the communications port will be disabled until the timing
              function has completed.

       READ   Reads  the  current  state  (open or closed) of a specified relay channel, or reads the current state of all relay
              channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary notation. If used as the latter, a five character  ASCII  string
              will be returned whose digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       WRITE  Writes  data  to  all  relay  channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary notation.  Data consists of a five
              character ASCII string whose digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       PAUSE  Loads an internal timer which will signal the host when the time interval has expired. Selectable range is from  1
              to  65535  mS.  This  function is useful when time-derived operations or events must be executed without having to
              rely on timekeeping from the host.  Note, the communications port will be disabled until this  function  has  com‐
              pleted.

       SEQUENCE
              Loads  a  string  of  WRITE  and PAUSE statements which will begin executing sequentially. The event will commence
              immediately following the reception of the carriage return which terminates the command  packet.  The  syntax  for
              each WRITE and PAUSE statements should be the same as if using these commands separately, and should be placed end
              to end with no separators between them.  Listed below is a typical sequence command string that will  perform  the
              following:

                 SW10000P60000W01000P5000W00100

              Close  relay  A, pause for 60 seconds, open relay A and close relay B, pause for 5 seconds, open relay B and close
              relay C. Note, if any syntax error exists within the sequence command string, the error symbol will be transmitted
              to the host and the sequence will not execute.

       DEFAULT
              Sets  the  default  state (open or closed) of a specified relay channel which will then be loaded upon power-up or
              brown-out.

       ECHO   Turns on or off the confirmation echo which is used to verify reception of a command.  If  reception  confirmation
              is not needed, turning ECHO off will increase the repetitive rate at which the host can manipulate the relays.

       ERROR  ERROR - Any data string sent from the host containing the correct header character but an invalid command or vari‐
              able will be responded to with this error indicator.

       RESET  Upon power-up or any other reset condition, this indicator is transmitted to the host. Note, all  user  configura‐
              tion data is stored in non-volatile memory. Therefore, a reset or loss of power will not corrupt these settings.

COMMANDS
       C relay timer
              Close  relay for a period equal to timer where relay can be &quot;A&quot; or &quot;E&quot; and timer can be 1 to 65535in milliseconds.
              If timer is omitted then the relay will remain closed. (Note 3)

               Closes the specified solid-state relay. The relay can be instructed to remain closed until a further command,  or
              open  back  up after a user defined time-out period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use
              the SEQUENCE command. If a time-out value is used, the communications port will be disabled until the timing func‐
              tion has completed.

       O relay timer
              Open  relay  for  a period equal to timer where relay can be &quot;A&quot; through &quot;E&quot; and timer can be 1 to 65535 millisec‐
              onds. If timer is omitted then the relay remains open. (Note 3)

              Opens the specified solid-state relay.  The relay can be instructed to remain open until  a  further  command,  or
              close  back up after a user defined time-out period in the range of 1 to 65535 mS. For longer time-out values, use
              the SEQUENCE command. If a time-out value is used, the communications port will be disabled until the timing func‐
              tion has completed.

       R relay
              Read  current state of relay. Returns relayC or relayO where relay is A-E. &quot;C&quot; means closed and &quot;O&quot; means open. If
              relay is omitted then read relays A-E as a 5-bit port in binary notation. 1 = closed, 0 = open. Relay A = MSB.

              Reads the current state (open or closed) of a specified relay channel, or reads the current  state  of  all  relay
              channels  simultaneously  as a 5-bit port in binary notation. If used as the latter, a five character ASCII string
              will be returned whose digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       W state
              Write state to relays A-E as a 5-bit port in binary notation where data can be 00000 to 11111 such  that  0  means
              open and 1 means closed. (Note 3)

              Writes data to all relay channels simultaneously as a 5-bit port in binary notation. Data consists of a five char‐
              acter ASCII string whose digits represent the open/close state of each relay channel.

       P timer
              Loads an internal timer which will signal the host when expired.  time = 1 to 65535 and is listed in milliseconds.
              When this function is complete, the &quot;P&quot; character will be returned to the host.

       S string
              Loads a string of WRITE and PAUSE statements which will begin executing sequentially. string may contain up to 110
              characters. When this function is complete, the &quot;S&quot; character will be returned to the host.

       D relay state
              Sets the default state of a specific relay which will be loaded upon power-up or brown-out. The relay can  be  &quot;A&quot;
              through  &quot;E&quot;.  The  state can be &quot;C&quot; or &quot;O&quot; where &quot;C&quot; means &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;O&quot; means &quot;open&quot;. If the state is omitted
              the current setting is read. For example, &quot;DBC&quot; will set the default state of module B to closed.

       X value
              Turns on or off the reception confirmation echo. The value can be 0 or 1 where 0 means &quot;off&quot; and 1 means &quot;on&quot;. The
              dfault is 1. If value omitted, reads the current setting.

NOTES
       1)     All command strings sent to the data module should be preceded with the header character (see Table 1), and termi‐
              nated with a carriage return. All responses from the data module will also appear in this format.

       2)     Any spaces shown above in the listing of the command strings are for clarity only. They should not be included  in
              the actual transmission from the host, nor expected in a response from the data module.

       3)     If  ECHO  is  on,  after  successful  execution this command will be echoed back to the host in the same format as
              received.
