nvmsplit(7)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                    nvmsplit(7)

NAME
       nvmsplit - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Firmware Image File Slicer

SYNOPSIS
       nvmsplit [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Extract all images from an Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact. Extracted images appear in files
       having the input file basename with sequence numbers indicating the relative position of the image  within  the  original
       file.  For  example,  image  file abc.nvm might result in files abc-00.nvm, abc-01.nvm, abc-02.nvm and so on. Each output
       file is a valid, single-image file and so they can be combined using program nvmmerge.

       Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block. Image blocks can contain  data,
       applets  or  programs.  Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute based on
       information in the image headers. Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual  obligations  made  by
       Atheros.

       This  program  is  part  of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppress routine messages. This option has no effect at this time.

       -v     Print component file names on stderr as they are created.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command  line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Atheros image file. By convention, Atheros Image files have a .nvm file extension but this  program
              does not enforce this convention. Invalid image files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

EXAMPLES
       The following example reads Atheros image file abc.nvm and creates one or more output files. Each file contains one image
       with associated header.

          # nvmsplit abc.nvm -v
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-00.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-01.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-02.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-03.nvm

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros image file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA. Consequently, public  informa‐
       tion  is  not  available.  Qualcomm  Atheros  reserves  the  right to change file structure or content in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.  This  program  is  reserved  for  use  by
       Atheros Field Engineers. Use of this program may void some contractual obligations made by Atheros.
