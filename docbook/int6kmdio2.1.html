int6kmdio2(7)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                  int6kmdio2(7)

NAME
       int6kmdio2 - Qualcomm Atheros 32-bit MDIO Register Editor

SYNOPSIS
       int6kmdio2 [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  or  write  the  global MDIO registers on an Atheros powerline device using multiple VS_MDIO_COMMAND vendor-specific
       management messages.  Commands are entered using 32-bit register and data  values  then  converted  to  three  equivalent
       16-bit  commands.   The  default operation is to read a register.  Registers are written only if data is specified on the
       command line.

       This program writes MDIO instructions using 802.3ae Clause 45 (address, data and mask) format.  See program int6kmdio for
       a similar program to write instructions using 802.3 Clause 22 (phy, reg, data and mask) format.

       This program is deprecated and may be removed in future toolkit releases.  Use program plcmdio32 instead.

OPTIONS
       -a address
              The  19-bit  global  register  address.   Some  devices  may not support all possible addresses.  Addresses may be
              expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values must be  prefixed  with  &quot;0x&quot;  or  &quot;0X&quot;.
              Binary values must be prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -d data
              A  32-bit  data  value  to be inserted into the specified register.  The specified data value is written when this
              option is present; otherwise the specified register is read and the content is  displayed.   Data  values  may  be
              expressed  in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.  Hexadecimal values are prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;.  Binary
              values are prefixed with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays  program  version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.  See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
