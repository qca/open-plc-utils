int6kprobe(7)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                  int6kprobe(7)

NAME
       int6kprobe - Qualcomm Atheros Diagnostic Network Probe

SYNOPSIS
       int6kprobe [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       None.

       This  program  is  part  of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit. See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c     Clear counters after read.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout. By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr  while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout. This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the  host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout. In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets  which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC  address  of  some  powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If more than one address is
              specified then operations are performed on each device in turn. The default address  is  local.  See  DEVICES  for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline  devices  use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hex‐
       adecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for  clarity.  For  example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for  the  Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether local, remote or foreign
              recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline  connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A  synonym  for  the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01. All local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
