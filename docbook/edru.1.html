edru(7)                                        Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                        edru(7)

NAME
       edru - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet II Data Read Utility

SYNOPSIS
       edru [options] [&gt;stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Listen  for incoming Ethernet II frames and write frame data, less header information, to stdout as a binary data stream.
       Since frame data can contain anything, users should direct output to a file or pipe it through some  type  of  filter  to
       prevent  corruption of the terminal session.  If all incoming data is known to be ASCII then directing stdout to the con‚Äê
       sole should not cause any problems.

       This program can be used to test remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline devices.  Remote device package serial  data  from
       their  local  host as Ethernet II frames and forwared them over the powerline to a specific destination.  The destination
       must be the Ethernet address of the receiving host.  This program reads such  frames,  discards  the  frame  headers  and
       writes the frame dat on stdout.  Data should appear exactly as sent by the remote hos.

OPTIONS
       -e ethertype
              The protocol (or ethertype) of interest expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal integer.  Prefix &quot;0x&quot; is optional.  This
              filters out frames having any other ethertype.  The default is ETH_P_802_2 as defined in if_ether.h.

       -i interface
              The host interface used to read frames.  The default is &quot;eth1&quot; because most people use &quot;eth0&quot; as  their  principle
              network  connection; however, if the string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined in the environment then it will over-ride the program
              default.  Any interface specified on the command line will over-ride the default.

       -q     Quiet mode.  This option has no effect at this time.

       -t milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -v     Verbose mode.  This option has no effect at this time.

ARGUMENTS
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  monitors host interface eth1 for incoming 802.2 Ethernet frames and writes frame data to stdout.
       In this case, stdout is the console.  Frame data is written, as it arrives, and forms a single output stream.   Directing
       output to  the console may corrupt your terminal session, forcing you to close the console window and open another one.

          # edru -ieth1

       The  next  example  does  the  same  thing but directs output to file test.log.  The output file may be inspected using a
       binary hex editor.  The programs continues to read and write until interrupted using ctrl-c or ctrl-z.

          # edru -ieth1 &gt; test.log

       The next example does the same thing but pipes output into program hexdmp which  displays  data  in  hexadecimal  format.
       This prevents terminal session corruptions caused by binary data.  Programhexdmp may not be provided with the toolkit.

          # edru -ieth1 | hexdmp
