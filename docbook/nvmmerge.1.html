nvmmerge(7)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                    nvmmerge(7)

NAME
       nvmmerge - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Firmware Image File Splicer

SYNOPSIS
       nvmmerge [options] file [file] [...]  [&gt;stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Combine multiple binary image files into a single Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact.

       Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.  Image blocks can contain data,
       applets or programs.  Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute  based  on
       information  in  image  headers.   Tampering  with  image headers or images may void some contractual obligations made by
       Atheros.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppresses printing of routine messages.  This option has no efect.

       -v     Print input file names on stderr as they are merged.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Atheros image file.  By convention, Atheros image files have a .nvm file extension but this program
              does not enforce this convention.  Invalid mage files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

EXAMPLES
       The following example combines three files, abc-00.nvm, abc-01.nvm and abc-06.nvm into one file abc.nvm.  Option -v  dis‐
       plays  the input file names as they are merged.  Program output is in binary format and so output should be directed to a
       file or pipe and not the console.

          # nvmmerge -v abc-00.nvm abc-01.nvm abc-06.nvm &gt; abc.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-00.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-01.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-06.nvm

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros image file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public informa‐
       tion  is  not  available.   Qualcomm  Atheros  reserves  the right to change file structure or content in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.  This  program  is  reserved  for  use  by
       Atheros Field Engineers.  Use of this program may void some contractual obligations made by Atheros.
