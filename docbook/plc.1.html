NAME
       Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       Qualcomm  Atheros provides the Powerline Toolkit to customers free of charge.  The toolkit contains source code and make‐
       files to build many useful programs.  It also includes example shell scripts that use these programs, in various ways, to
       interrogate,  control  and  manage  QCA powerline devices.  The programs are intended for hardware engineers and software
       developers, consequently.  They are not intended for end users or computer novices.   Most  are  compact  and  simple  by
       design and can be included and executed on embedded platforms having few resources.

INSTALLATION
       The  Powerline  Toolkit  is  distributed as a tarball named plc-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz or plc-utils-x.x.x.tar.bz2.  Users may
       unpack the tarball and change to the directory that it creates to inspect the source code and documentation.  To  compile
       the  source code, type &quot;make&quot;.  To install the programs, type &quot;make install&quot;.  To install man pages, type &quot;make manuals&quot;.
       To uninstall programs and man pages, type &quot;make uninstall&quot;.  To read about the Toolkit,  browse  file  docbook/index.html
       and  docbook/toolkit.html.   This  package  does  not automatically install scripts or html pages.  They must be manually
       copied to the preferred locations.

       We recommend that you login as root before installing this package; otherwise, you will be prompted for the root password
       as  each  component  is  installed.   On  some  systems,  &quot;sudo  make  install&quot;  will  work.   Programs  are installed in
       /usr/local/bin.  Man pages are installed in /usr/share/man/man[1-9].  If these folders are not correct for  your  system,
       or  if  you want to install in other folders, then edit folder names defined in the Makefile in each package folder.  The
       package has been compiled in a variety of Linux distributions (debian, ubuntu, redhat, monta vista, amilda) and on MacOSX
       (10.5, 10.6).  It has also been cross-compiled for MIPS and Freescale iMX35 but QCA does not support general cross compi‐
       lation efforts.

       Although this package has been compiled on several platforms, there is no guarantee that it will compile  without  errors
       or  warnings  on non-GNU/Linux platforms.  We continuously update the package but do not attempt to compile or test it on
       systems other than GNU/Linux and Microsoft VisualStudio .NET.  Some programs have been excluded from the Windows  instal‐
       lation for technical reasons.

BACKGROUND
       HomePlug 1.0 and HomePlug AV are industry standard protocols for powerline communications.  Qualcomm Atheros manufactures
       a family of chipsets that conform to these standards and have various USB, PCI, Ethernet, MII, SPI and UART  host  inter‐
       faces.

       The HomePlug 1.0 protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x887B and uses special message formats.

       The  HomePlug  AV  protocol  is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype 0x88E1 and special message formats.  A subset of those
       message formats are left unspecified so that chipset vendors can define message formats for their own products.  QCA ven‐
       dor  specific  management  message formats are described in the QCA HomePlugAV Firmware Technical Reference Manual.  This
       toolkit uses these messages to communicate with QCA powerline devices.  Customers may use the toolkit to send these  mes‐
       sages, explore device behavior and develope their own applications.

       Each  program  in  the  toolkit deals with a narrow aspect of QCA powerline device management but they can be called from
       shell scripts to perform complex tasks.  With them, one  can  identify  chipset  hardware  and  firmware  version,  reset
       devices,  flash  devices,  identify other QCA network devices, validate *.pib and *.nvm files, sniff HomePlug AV Ethernet
       frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on.

       The source code is designed to demonstrate and educate and may be modified without obligation to Qualcomm  Atheros.   The
       QCA Application Engineering Team would appreciate feedback concerning changes that improve the useability, reliability or
       efficiency.  Keep in mind that these tools are supposed to be small and simple.

TOOLS
       There are many independent programs in this package.  Significant ones are listed below.  See html/overview.html for more
       information about the Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

       ampboot
              A  command  line utility to start, and optionally flash, newer Atheros Powerline Devices.  It is an alternative to
              program int6kboot that may have additional options specific to the AR7400.

       amphost
              A example embedded host emulator that responds to VS_HST_ACTION messages sent from a flash-less device to a  local
              host  processor.   It  can be used to investigate and verify device-to-host interaction.  The Atheros embedded API
              can perform similar functionality in a production environment.

              A command line utility to enable or disable sniffer mode on an Atheros Powerline Device.

       amptest
              A command line utility to download and execute a sequence of test applets to the local powerline  device.   It  is
              not  for  general  use  because  there are no interlocks to prevent loading images designed for other platforms or
              loading images in illogical order.  It is an laternative to, and replacement for, program int6ktest.

       amptool
              A basic device manager used to inspect and control Atheros powerline devices connected to the local host.   It  is
              similar to int6k but is specific to the AR7400 chipsets.

              having  optional  comments and whitespace.  Comments and white space are stripped from the input file and the hex‐
              adecimal byte codes are transmitted as Ethernet frames.

       ethcat Send on or more files to a remote UART-enabled powerline device using IEEE  802.2  Ethernet  frames.   Transmitted
              frames are assembled into a serial data stream and forwarded to the local host by the remote device.

       fp     A  command line utility that prints the SHA256 digest for one or more files based on their content.  Output can be
              used to compare files or identify files based soley on their content despite any filename changes.

              more pass phrases, entered on the command line, to either DAKs, NMKs or NIDs.  It is similar to hpavkeys  but con‐
              verts a limited number of pass phrases at one time.

       hpavkeys
              A  HomePlug  AV key generator.  This program is similar to hpavkey but converts large number of pass phrases, read
              from stdin, and converts them to either DAKs, NMKs or NIDs.

       int6k  A basic device manager used to inspect and control Atheros INT6x00 devices connected to the  local  host.   It  is
              similar  to  amptool  and  plctool but is implemented for INT6000, INT6300 and INT6400 devices only.  Some options
              work on newer chipsets but otherd do not.
