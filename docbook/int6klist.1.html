int6klist(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   int6klist(7)

NAME
       int6klist - List Atheros Device Addresses

SYNOPSIS
       int6klist [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       print  the  local  device  address or all network device addresses for a specific device.  This program is ideal for that
       special script jokey in your life.  It only prints device addresses.  Nothing else.

       Devices are detected using one of two methods.  The two methods can be used in combination to determine network topology.

       The  first  method  sends  one VS_SW_VER message to the Qualcomm Atheros Local Management Address and prints the Ethernet
       source address found in each received confirmation message.  The method is used when no device addresses  appear  on  the
       command  line.   The  result is a list of all local devices, being this connected directly to the local host.  Each local
       device device may bridge to an independent powerline network having remote devices as members.

       The second method sends one VS_NW_INFO message to each specified device and prints the Ethernet source address  found  in
       each  received  message plus the Ethernet addresses of each network station identified in that message body.  This method
       is used whenever one, or more, device addresses appear on the command line.  It is possible  to  query  remote  powerline
       devices directly and so duplicate devices addresses are printed when devices share powerline neighbors.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -b     Print bridge device addresses.  Each specified device reports it’s own address. This option has no  effect  if  no
              devices are specified.

       -i     Select  the  host Ethernet interface. All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized. The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface. This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -n     Append a newline to output.

       -q     Enter quiet mode. This option has no effect at this time.

       -r     Print remote device addresses. Each specified device reports neighbor device addresses. This option has no  effect
              when no devices are speceified.

       -s     Insert a newline, instead of a space, between each device address.

       -v     Enter verbose mode. All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print  program version information on stdout. This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The  MAC address of some powerline device. More than one address may be specified. If omitted the the program out‐
              put consists of local device addresses only. Otherwise, output conisists of the specified device followed  by  all
              devices  associated  with  it.  The  default  address  is local. See DEVICES for information about symbolic device
              addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as  12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits  in  upper, lower or mixed character case. Octets may be separated with colons for clarity. For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. All devices, whether  local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA),  00:B0:52:00:00:01.  All  local
              Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not. A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection. A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  lists all local devices because no device was specified. Because no devices are specified on the
       command line, a VS_SW_VER message is sent to 00:B0:52:00:00:01 and device responses are collected. As we can  see,  there
       is  only  one  local device available at this time. Observe that the prompt appears immediately after the address because
       newlines are omitted by default.

          # int6klist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 #

       The next examples do the same thing but this time there are several local devicer available.

          # int6klist
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 # int6k

       The next example queries the first local device from  the  previous  example,  00:B0:52:BE:EF:04,  for  a  list  neighbor
       devices.  This  time a VS_NW_INFO message is sent because we named a device on the command line. The named device happens
       to be a local device but it need not be. We can see that the device has no neighbors.

          # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 # int6k

       The next example we query the next ocal device, 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02, and find that it has two neighbor devices that did not
       show  up  earlier  because  they are remote devices. Observe that the three devices comprise a complete logical powerline
       network. Device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 is connected to the local host but 00:0F:33:F2:01:21  and  00:0f:00:F2:01:13  are  con‐
       nected to other hosts, somewhere.

          # int6klist 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       The  next  example  shows  that we can query multiple devices at a time for neighbors. We have copied the output from the
       second example and pasted it onto the command line. We now have a list of all devices, local and remote.

          # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13

       This next example does the same thing but uses option -n to append a newline after each query. This output is  eaiser  to
       understand because each device queried starts on a new line and is followed by any neighbors.

          # int6klist 00:B0:52:BE:EF:04 00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:B0:52:BA:BE:01 -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This  example  invokes int6klist which returns a list of local devices. That list is inserted into another int6klist com‐
       mand line. This demontrates how program output can be used in scripts.

          # int6klist $(int6klist) -n
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01

       This next example accomplishes the same thing since all local device respond with a list of powerline neighbors.

          # int6klist local
          00:B0:52:BE:EF:04
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:02 00:0F:33:F2:01:21 00:0F:00:F2:01:13
          00:B0:52:BA:BE:01
