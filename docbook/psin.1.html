psin(7)                                        Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                        psin(7)

NAME
       psin - Import PIB Prescalers

SYNOPSIS
       psin [options] [&lt;stdin] file

SYNOPSIS
       Read  an  amplitude  map  from stdin and insert it into a nexisting PIB file, replacing the previous amplitude map.  This
       program permits custom amplitude maps to be loaded into a PIB file.  It can also pipe a map directly from one PIB file to
       another.   Atheros  can  provide  standard amplitude maps (prescalers) that conform to most national or international EMI
       regulations.  Generally speaking, these maps should not be modified but there are execeptions.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

CAVEATS
       The  Atheros  Windows  Device  Manager determines the type of prescalers stored in the PIB by inspecting the ToneMaskType
       code which is also stored in the PIB but is not part of the prescaler set.  If this  program  is  used  to  store  a  new
       prescaler  set  in  a  PIB and the ToneMaskType code is not updated to reflect the change then the Windows Device Manager
       will continue to display the previous prescaler type.  This will confuse Windows Device Manager users.  Use program  set‚Ä‚Äê
       pib to set the ToneMaskType code and program pskey to verify the true prescaler type.

OPTIONS
       None.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name  of  an  Atheros  Parameter  Information Block (PIB) file.  The original prescalers are replaced and the
              checksum is re-computed.  By convention, PIB files have a .pib extension but this program does  not  enforce  that
              convention and does not make any assumption based on filename or extension but the program will reject invalid PIB
              files.  Only one file may be specified on the command line.

FILES
       An amplitude map consists of 1155 frequency-amplitude pairs.  Each pair consists of a decimal  index  and  a  hexadecimal
       scaler value.  The index represents a frequecy from 1.8 mhz through 30 mhz.  The scaler represents the amplitude attenua‚Äê
       tion applied at that frequency.  The frequency and attenuation are computed as follows.

          frequency = (index + 74) / 40.96
          decibels = 20 * log10 (scaler / 256)

EXAMPLE
       The following example loads prescaler file abc.psc into PIB file abc.pib.  The ToneMaskType code is not updated  by  this
       operation  and should be updated separately to avoid confusing Windows Device Manager users.  Program setpib is one means
       of updating this code.

          # psin &lt; abc.psc abc.pib

DISCLAIMER
       PIB file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public information is not
       available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify PIB file structure or content in future firmware releases with‚Äê
       out any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

       Tampering with prescaler settings may violate national or international electo-magnetic emission standards  and  lead  to
       fines  or  penalties.   Qualcomm  Atheros  shall  not  be  held responsible for any consequences of modifications made to
       prescaler sets provided to their customers.
