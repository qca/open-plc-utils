plcget(7)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                      plcget(7)

NAME
       plcget - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Get Propery

SYNOPSIS
       plcget [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  a  specific  property value from a Qualcomm Atheros powerline device using the VS_GET_PROPERTY message.  Properties
       are selected using their numeric property identifier.  Property names are not supported.  Property values are printed  on
       stdout in hexadecimal format by default.  Alternate formats are ASCII, binary and decimal.

       Only selected properties can be read using this message type.  See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Man‐
       ual for supported properties and versions.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -a     Display output in string format where each byte appears as an ASCII character.  Non-ASCII characters are displayed
              as a period or full-stop.  This option is useful for displaying HFID property values.

       -b     Display output in binary format where each byte appears as 8 bits or binary digits.  This  option  is  useful  for
              interpreting bit-mapped property values.

       -d     Display output in decimal format where each byte appears as three decimal digits.  This option is useful for prop‐
              erties with small integer values.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -h     Display  output in hexadecimal format where each byte appears as a hexadecimal octet consisting of two hexadecimal
              digits.  Hexadecimal is the default output format.

       -n number
              The property identifier or property version.  Property identifiers and versions  are  entered  as  32-bit  decimal
              integers.  Property names are not supported.  The default is 0.  This option may appear more than once on the com‐
              mand line.  The first occurance specifies the property identifier.  The second occurances specifies  the  property
              version.  See the Firmware Technical Reference Manual for an list of valid property identifiers and versions.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses received via this
              interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their  principle  network
              connection;  however,  if environment string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
              This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -v     Prints additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

       -?,--help
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on  the  command
              line except version information.

       -!,--version
              Displays  program  version information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other options on the com‐
              mand line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

ARGUMENTS
       device The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified.  If more than  one  address  is
              specified  then  operations  are performed on each device in turn.  The default address is local.  See DEVICES for
              information about symbolic device addresses.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12  hex‐
       adecimal  digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.  For example,
       &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and &quot;00b052:000001&quot; are valid and equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       all    Same as &quot;broadcast&quot;.

       broadcast
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local,  remote  or  foreign
              recognize  messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
              A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  recognize  this address but remote and foreign devices do not.  A remote device is any device at
              the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
