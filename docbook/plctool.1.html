plctool(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     plctool(7)

NAME
       plctool - Qualcomm Atheros Panther/Lynx Powerline Device Manager

SYNOPSIS
       plctool [options] [device] [device] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  version  of  the Qualcomm Atheros Device Manager for Linux performs basic operations on Atheros QCA7420 and QCA7421
       devices using the raw Ethernet protocol described in the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical  Reference  Man‐
       ual.   It  can  be used to interrogate and control devices or upgrade firmware if on-board NVRAM is present.  See amptool
       for a similar utility that supports AR7400 devices.  It supports chipsets QCA6410, QCA7000 and QCA7420.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This  program  version  is  identical  to  legacy program int6k except for option -m which uses version 1 of the Qualcomm
       Atheros VS_NW_INFO vendor-specific message.  Older firmware versions may not recognize this message version.

OPTIONS
       -a     Read device attributes using VS_OP_ATTRIBUTES.  Attributes are short strings and  integers  that  describe  device
              hardware  and firmware.  They are concatenated to form the output that is similar to option -r but derived differ‐
              ently.

       -B action
              Press the simple connect pushbutton using VS_PB_ENC.  The action can be specified by number 1, 2 or 3 or by symbol
              &quot;join&quot;,  &quot;leave&quot; or &quot;status&quot;, respectively.  Send action 1 to both devices that are expected to join.  Send action
              2 to each device that is expected to leave the network.

       -d filename
              Read Watchdog Report from the device and write it to the named file in binary format using VS_WD_RPT.  The  report
              file  can  be  sent  to Qualcomm Atheros for technical analysis.  No assumptions are made based on filename and no
              filename convetions are enforced; however, you should use a .log file extension to indicate binary format.

       -D xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the 16 octet Device Access Key (DAK) in hex format.  The DAK is used by option -J.  It may also be  set  to
              &quot;key1&quot; or &quot;key2&quot; as explained in the KEYS section.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  Normally, status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary pro‐
              gram output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -f     Read flash memory parameters using VS_GET_NVM.  An error will be reported if no flash memory is present.

       -F[F]  Write previously downloaded MAC and PIB to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.  Adding a second F here or another -F  anywhere
              on  the command line WILL NOT force-flash a blank or corrupted NVRAM as with programs int6k and amptool.  Firmware
              loaded from NVRAM will treat force-flash as an error.  This option can be used to create factory settings but can‐
              not  be  used  to  change  them once created.  Subsequent use creates and updates operational settings that can be
              erased using a factory reset.  This option is executed after all others on the command line,  except  for  the  -R
              option.

       -g     Read multicast group information discovered while IGMP snooping using VS_MULTICAST_INFO.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -I     Read the device PIB header using VS_MODULE_OPERATION and print the PIB major and  minor  revision  number,  Device
              Access  Key (DAK), Network Membership Key (NMK), MAC address and other identity information on stdout.  The values
              displayed can be changed using program modpib.

       -J xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on a remote device using VS_SET_KEY.  This option is similar to option -K but
              requires  the  remote  device  MAC  and DAK in addition to the NMK and local device MAC address.  The NMK value is
              defined using option -K unless you want to use the default value.  The remote  DAK  is  defined  using  option  -D
              unless  you  want to use the default value.  Programming remote device keys is complicated.  It is often easier to
              connect the device directly to the host and use the -K option.

       -K xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
              Define the Network Membership Key (NMK) value used by options -M or -J.  The symbolic names &quot;key1&quot; and &quot;key2&quot;  are
              recognized as described in the KEY section.

       -l count
              Define the number of times that the command will be repeated for each device specified.  Normally, you will repeat
              operations on one device only.

       -L     Read and display powerline link status.

       -m     Read network membership information using VS_NW_INFO.  This can be used to determine network configuration.

       -M     Set the Network Membership Key (NMK) on the local device using VS_SET_KEY.  The NMK value is specified  using  the
              -K option unless you want to use the default value.

       -n filename
              Read  firmware  from  the  device SDRAM and write it to the named .nvm file using multiple VS_RD_MOD messages.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.  This option is performed  before
              option -N when both are specified.

       -N filename
              Read  the  named  .nvm file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages.  No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .nvm  format  will  be
              rejected.  This option is executed after -n when both are specified.

       -p filename
              Read parameters from the device NVRAM and write them to the named .pib file using multiple VS_RD_MOD messages.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no filename convetions are enforced.  This option  is  executed  before
              option BP when both are specified.

       -P filename
              Read  the  named  .pib file and write it to the device using multiple VS_WR_MOD messages.  No assumptions are made
              based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced; however, files having  invalid  .pib  format  will  be
              rejected.  This option is executed after -p when both are specified.

       -q     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -Q     Quick  flash.  The program will not wait for a device to reset or the firmware to restart after writing flash mem‐
              ory.  This option is desirable with newer firmware that writes flash memory in the background.  It has  no  effect
              unless used with option -F or -C.

       -r     Read device firmware and hardware revision using VS_SW_VER.  Output is similar to option -a but is derived differ‐
              ently.

       -R     Reset the device using VS_RS_DEV.  This option is executed after all others on the same command line.

       -t milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -T     Restore  factory defaults.  This permanently erases all PIB changes made since the device was last programmed with
              factory default settings.  The device will automatically reset and reboot.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which  can
              be saved as text files for reference.

       -w seconds
              Defines  the  number  of  seconds to wait before repeating command line options.  This option has no effect unless
              option -l is also specified with a non-zero value.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead  of  continuing  with  remaining  iterations,  operations  or
              devices.   Normally,  the program reports errors and moves on to the next operation, iteration or device depending
              on the command line.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -?,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       device The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be  specified  on  the  command
              line.   If  more  than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.  The default
              address is local.  as explained in the DEVICES section.

KEYS
       Passwords are variable length character strings that end-users can remember.  Keys are fixed length binary values created
       by encrypting passwords.  There are two encryption algorithms for HomePlugAV.  One for DAKs and the other for NMKs.  This
       means that a given password will produce different keys depending on use.  This program only deals with keys because that
       is what powerline devices recognize.  The passwords that generated the keys are irrelevant here.

       Encryption  keys  are  tedious  to type and prone to error.  For convenience, symbolic names have been assigned to common
       encryption keys and are recognized by options -D and -K.

       key1   Key  for  encrypted  password  &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;.   This  is  &quot;689F074B8B0275A2710B0B5779AD1630&quot;  for  option  -D   and
              &quot;50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7&quot; for option -K.

       key2   Key  for  encrypted  password  &quot;HomePlugAV0123&quot;.   This  is  &quot;F084B4E8F6069FF1300C9BDB812367FF&quot;  for option -D and
              &quot;B59319D7E8157BA001B018669CCEE30D&quot; for option -K.

       none   Always &quot;00000000000000000000000000000000&quot;.

DEVICES
       Powerline devices use Ethernet hardware, or Media Access Control (MAC), addresses.  Device addresses are  12  hexadecimal
       digits  (0123456789ABCDEFabcdef)  in upper, lower or mixed case.  Individual octets may be separated by colons, for clar‐
       ity, but not all octets need to be seperated.  For example, &quot;00b052000001&quot;, &quot;00:b0:52:00:00:01&quot; and  &quot;00b052:000001&quot;  are
       valid and equivalent.

       These symbolic addresses are recognized by this program and may be used instead of the actual address value.

       all    Equivalent to &quot;broadcast&quot;, described next.

       broadcast
              A  synonym  for the standard Ethernet broadcast address, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  All devices, whether local, remote or
              foreign will respond to this address.

       local  A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), 00:B0:52:00:00:01.   All  local
              Atheros  devices  will  recognize  this  address  but remote and foreign devices will not.  A remote device is any
              device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros HomePlug AV Vendor Specific Management Message structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL
       USA.   Consequently,  public  information  may  not  be available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to modify message
       structure or content in future firmware releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.

EXAMPLES
          # plctool -n old.nvm -p old.pib -N new.nvm -P new.pib -F 01:23:45:67:89:AB

       Performs 5 operations on one device.  Uploads the firmware and PIB from the device and writes them to files  old.nvm  and
       old.pib,  respectively.   Reads files new.nvm and new.pib and downloads them as new firmware and PIB, respectively.  Com‐
       mits the downloaded firmware and PIB to NVRAM.  Operations are executed in the order just  described  regardless  of  the
       order specified on the command line.  If you want reading and writing to occur in a different order then you must use two
       or more commands to accomplish tasks in the order you want.

          # plctool -N new.nvm 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # plctool -P new.pib 01:23:45:67:89:28
          # plctool -C 3 01:23:45:67:89:28

       It is not neccessary to specify all operations on one command line.  The three command lines  above  do  essentially  the
       same  thing  as  the command line shown in the previou example.  Notice that this example uses -C 3, instead of -F, as an
       alternate way to write MAC and PIB to NVRAM.  Specifying -C 1, instead, would write the .nvm file only.   Specifying,  -C
       2, instead, would write the .pib file only.  THe value 3 is the logical OR of 1 and 2.

          # plctool -N new.nvm -P new.pib -FF local

       Downloads  file  new.nvm  and  file  new.pib  and  force  flashes the local device.  Force flashing only works on running
       firmware that has been downloaded and stated by the Qualcomm Atheros  Boot  Loader.   See  plctoolf  to  download,  start
       firmware and perform a force flash in one operation.

          # plctool -MK key1
          # plctool -M

       These  two commands are equivalent.  They set the NMK on the local device to key1 as descripted in the KEYS section.  The
       first command resets the NMK on the local device with -M then specifies the NMK as key1.  The second  command  omits  the
       key specification since key1 is the program default NMK.  One could, of course, type the encryption key.
