int6ktest(7)                                   Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                   int6ktest(7)

NAME
       int6ktest - Qualcomm Atheros Test Applet Loader

SYNOPSIS
       int6ktest [options] [file] [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Download  and  execute  one or more test applets on the local powerline device.  An applet is a small firmware image that
       can be started by the bootloader and that returns to the bootloader when done.

       An Atheros image file can contain one or more firmware images.  Each image is preceded by a  header  that  specifies  the
       image  size, load address and start address.  int6ktest sequentially dowloads and executes each image found in each image
       file specified as a command line argument.  It waits for each image to complete before it will download and  execute  the
       next image.  The program terminates once all images in all image files have been executed or some image fails to complete
       within 60 seconds.

       Most applets return to the Bootloader on successful completion so that another applet can  be  downloaded  and  executed.
       This  allows  applet  chains  to  be  executed  using one command.  A chain may consist of one image file containing many
       applets or several image files containing one applet each or any combination.  The chain will break, after a timeout,  if
       any applet in the chain fails to return to the Bootloader.

       The  toolkit  contains  a  set  of useful applets in folder applets.  Most, if not all, are as single applet image files.
       Program chknvm can be used to inspect image files and programs nvmmerge and nvmsplit can be used to assemble  and  disas‐
       semble multi-applet image files.  This allows custom applet chains to be created and kept together in one file.  The num‐
       ber and quality of available applets will probably increase with time.

       Users should take the time to understand the applets they attempt to execute or confusion may result.  Each applet should
       have  an associated man page to explain what it does and how it works.  Most applets execute and return to the bootloader
       within seconds but some loop indefinitely or stop on failure.  Newer applets print test progress and outcomes on the con‐
       sole but older applets merely flash device LEDs to indicate test progress and outcomes.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       This program is an alternative to program amptest but is deprecated.  In the  future,  applet  designers  should  develop
       applets for amptest instead of this program.

OPTIONS
       -c count
              The  number  of times the program will poll the device before declaring an event failure.  The program will wait a
              fixed period of time between each poll attempt.  Overall wait time is count/frequency where count can be  modified
              using  option  -c.   Overall  wait  time is always approximate since operating system overhead and latency are not
              taken into account.  The default count is 60.

       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -l     Sequentially execute and re-execute all applets in all files on the command line until the program  is  terminated
              with ^C.

       -p frequency
              The  polling  frequency  expressed in polls-per-second.  For example, 1 means one poll per second and 10 means ten
              polls per second.  Overall wait time is count/frequency where count may be modified using option -c.  Overall wait
              time  is  always  approximate since operating system overhead and latency are not taken into account.  The default
              frequency is 5.

       -q     Suppresses normal progress and status messages.

       -t milliseconds
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is  the  maximum  time  allowed  for  a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  Specifically, this option prints incoming and outgoing frames in hexadec‐
              imal format on stdout.  Output can be directed to a text file for analysis.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead of moving on to the next applet.  Error exits return  a  non-
              zero value to the shell.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name of an Atheros image file.  The image file may contain one or more images.  Each image will be downloaded
              and executed in turn until all images are executed or an image fails to return the device to the Bootloader within
              1 hour for some reason.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example sequentially downloads then executes each image in file abc.nvm in turn.  Each image must complete
       and return to the bootloader before the next one downloads.  Observe that no device address  is  needed  because  Atheros
       powerline devices all use address 00:b0:52:00:00:01 when in bootloader mode.

          # int6ktest abc.nvm

       The  following  example  will  sequentially  download and execute the images in each file abc.nvm, def.nvm and ghi.nvm in
       turn.

          # int6ktest abc.nvm def.nvm ghi.nvm
