amptest(7)                                     Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                     amptest(7)

NAME
       amptest - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Test Applet Loader

SYNOPSIS
       amptest [options] [file] [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Download  and  execute  one or more test applets on the local Qualcomm Atheros PLC device.  An applet is a small firmware
       image that can be started by the bootloader and that returns to the bootloader when done.  This program is an alternative
       to program int6ktest but has been replaced by program plctest.

       A  Qualcomm Atheros firmware image file may contain one or more applets.  Each applet is preceded by a header that speci‐
       fies the image size, load address and start address.  Program amptest sequentially downloads  and  executes  each  applet
       found in each image file specified on the command line.  It waits for each applet to complete before downloading and exe‐
       cuting the next one.  The program terminates once all applets in all files have been executed or  some  applet  fails  to
       complete within 60 seconds.

       Most  applets  return  to  the Bootloader on successful completion so that another applet can be downloaded and executed.
       This allows applet chains to be executed using one command.  A chain may consist of one file containing multiple  applets
       or  multiple  files  each  containing  one applet or any combination of single and multiple applet files.  The chain will
       break, after a timeout, if any applet in the chain fails to return to the Bootloader in time.  Failure to return in  time
       may be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on applet design.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the APT man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

COMMENTS
       The Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit contains a set of legacy applets in folder applets.  These were designed  for  use
       with  program int6ktest and most will not display console messages properly using this program.  A new series of compati‐
       ble applets are under development and should be available through Atheros Field Application Engineering.

       Assuming a good set of applets are available, this program is ideal for testing reference  designs  for  performance  and
       production  units  for defects.  Applets may become available for testing onboard connections, memory integrity and noise
       immunity.  Consult with Atheros Field Application Engineering for applet availability.

OPTIONS
       -e     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while  primary
              program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -i interface
              Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -l     Sequentially execute and re-execute all applets in all files on the command line until the program  is  terminated
              with ^C.

       -q     Suppresses normal progress and status messages.

       -t milliseconds
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values  range  from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time allowed for a
              response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -v     Print additional information on stdout.  Specifically, this option prints incoming and outgoing frames in hexadec‐
              imal format on stdout.  Output can be directed to a text file for analysis.

       -w seconds
              Application timeout in seconds.  This application will wait this long for an applet to terminate and return to the
              bootloader before reporting an error and proceeding to the next applet.

       -x     Cause the program to exit on the first error instead of moving on to the next applet.  Error exits return  a  non-
              zero value to the shell.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name of an Atheros image file.  The image file may contain one or more images.  Each image will be downloaded
              and executed in turn until all images are executed or an image fails to return to the Bootloader within  1  minute
              for some reason.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example sequentially downloads then executes each image in file abc.nvm in turn.  Each image must complete
       and return to the bootloader before the next one downloads.  Observe that no device address  is  needed  because  Atheros
       powerline devices use address 00:b0:52:00:00:01 when in bootloader mode.

          # amptest abc.nvm

       The  following  example  will  sequentially  download and execute the images in each file abc.nvm, def.nvm and ghi.nvm in
       turn.

          # amptest abc.nvm def.nvm ghi.nvm

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros image file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public informa‐
       tion  is  not  available.   Qualcomm  Atheros  reserves  the right to change file structure or content in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.  This  program  is  reserved  for  use  by
