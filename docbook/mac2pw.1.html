mac2pw(7)                                      Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit                                      mac2pw(7)

NAME
       mac2pw - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet Device Password Generator

SYNOPSIS
       mac2pw [options] address [address] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Print  a  range  of  consecutive  Ethernet addresses and passwords on stdout.  The starting address and address range are
       specified.  Computed passwords consist of upper case letters (A-Z) with separators.   The  algorithm  used  here  is  not
       required  for HomePlug AV compliance and so vendors are free to use other methods to generate their own device passwords.

       This program may be used to generate passwords for large numbers of consecutive device addresses over a fixed range.   It
       complements  program  mac2pwd  which  generates  passwords  for non-consecutive device addresses that may occur in unpre‐
       dictable order.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

CAVEATS
       Atheros  provides  this program as a simple means of generating unique and apparently random device passwords for a large
       volume of Ethernet devices.  It uses a Linear Congruential Random Number Generator  to  produce  a  single-wheel  Bazerie
       Cylinder  and to select characters from that cylinder.  The algorithm used is adequate for this purpose and nothing more.
       Vendors are encouraged to develop their own means of generating passwords for the reasons mentioned below.

       Device addresses can be determined using a variety of network management programs.  Anyone having access to this program,
       or  the  algorithm  used,  could  compute the device password and gain access to device features reserved for priviledged
       users.

OPTIONS
       -b bunch
              The password bunching factor.  Passwords have a fixed number of upper case letters broken  into  groups  separated
              with dashes.  The number of letters in each group are the bunch value.  When bunch is 0, password length is count.
              When bunch is 1, password length is twice count because every other character will be a dash.  The  minimum  is  0
              and the maximum is 255.  The default is 4.

       -l count
              The  number  of  letters  in  the password string.  Overall password length is the sum of count plus the number of
              delimiters implied by bunch.  The minimum is 12 and the maximum is 64.  The default is 16.

       -n number
              The number of consecutive addresses and passwords to compute and print.  The minimum  is  0  and  the  maximum  is
              1677215  or  0xFFFFFF.   The default is 1.  In addition, number cannot exceed the remaining available addresses in
              the vendor range.  For example, given start address 00:B0:52:FF:FF:00, there are only 255 remaining  addresses  in
              the 00:B0:52 vendor range so it would be an error to request more than that number.

       -q     Quiet  mode.   Exclude  the  device  address on output.  This option can be used in scripts to return the password
              associated with a given device address.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Prefix each line with a ’0’ column.  The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) uses the first column
              of a password database file to indicate which addresses and passwords have already been used.

       -?,--help
              Print program help information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       address
              The  first  Ethernet  address  expressed as 12 consecutive hexadecimal digits.  Puncutation is not permitted.  The
              final address of the range is computed by adding number to this address.  This argument is required.  There is  no
              default  address.   If  more than one device address is specified then an address/password series will be computed
              for each.

EXAMPLES
       The following example prints the given device address and associated password string on stdout.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001
          00B052000001 MLPB-YLQM-YSSL-BMBB

       This example does the same thing but ommits the device address.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
          MLPB-YLQM-YSSL-BMBB

       The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords on stdout.  The  starting  device  address  is
       given and option -n specifies the number of addresses to print.  Output can be directed to a file.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10
          00B052000001 MLPB-YLQM-YSSL-BMBB
          00B052000002 KSQJ-ZZFT-TNJL-VZIH
          00B052000003 HDFV-SEHB-LFWM-VLBF
          00B052000004 LBPL-NZSM-VPUC-XPLM
          00B052000005 JXDN-UYFQ-NISF-MIGH
          00B052000006 YPOS-UVDA-VMML-JBBP
          00B052000007 PJAO-DWSS-OQYL-XDTU
          00B052000008 SKVQ-CNRF-PUDM-WKZC
          00B052000009 YQTM-LHTJ-FYQC-YVNW
          00B05200000A KADM-CHII-KYVF-FQRZ

       The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but starts from a different device
       address.  The address range here overlaps the range shown above but identical device addresses have identical  passwords.

          # mac2pw 00B052000006 -n 10
          00B052000006 YPOS-UVDA-VMML-JBBP
          00B052000007 PJAO-DWSS-OQYL-XDTU
          00B052000008 SKVQ-CNRF-PUDM-WKZC
          00B052000009 YQTM-LHTJ-FYQC-YVNW
          00B05200000A KADM-CHII-KYVF-FQRZ
          00B05200000B YCZS-MVPX-VNFL-CLVZ
          00B05200000C PIBZ-DKMB-YMJL-QTMQ
          00B05200000D DPTA-HOEK-QERM-HJIY
          00B05200000E TMQQ-YFCW-OIVC-OGWO
          00B05200000F QUHL-PSQM-HHPF-PHLT

       The  following  example  prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but changes the password length
       and letter grouping.  Option -l specifies 12 letters and option -b specifies a bunching factor of three.  Use a  bunching
       factor of 0 to remove dashes.

          # mac2pw 00B052000006 -n 10 -l 12 -b 3
          00B052000006 YPO-SUV-DAV-MML

          00B05200000F QUH-LPS-QMH-HPF

       The  following  example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords but inserts a 0 at the start of each line to
       indicate that the address and password have not been used.  The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) will set the 0 to  1
       after it programs a device.  This format is simlar to PTS DBBuilder Utility output.
