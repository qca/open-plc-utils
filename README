#   of the Powerline Toolkit continue to be available under the 
#   previous license.

This package is an open version of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline
Toolkit. It may be distributed as a zip, gzip or bzip2 tarball that
contains source code and build scripts for Linux, OpenBSD, MAC OSX
and Microsoft Windows. It also contains documentation in docbook XML,
HTML and plain text format.

We recommend that you open file docbook/index.html with a web browser
the read Chapter 1 before attempting to install or use the toolkit
but the impatient may do the following and survive...

TO INSTALL
----------

1. Enter package folder using "cd open-plc-utils".
2. Compile all tools using "make".
3. Install all tools to /usr/local/bin using "sudo make install".
4. Compile and install man pages in  /usr/share/man/man1 using "sudo make manuals".
5  Change to the documentation folder using "cd docbook".
6. Add page index.html to browser favorites.
7. Add page toolkit.html to browser favorites.

Note: 'make' is assumed to be the GNU make command (often available
      under the name 'gmake'). Also, gcc is assumed to be the system
      default compiler. On BSD systems, this may be clang. If so,
      replace 'gcc' with 'clang' in the top level make.def file.

TO UNINSTALL
------------

1. Enter package folder using "cd open-plc-utils".
2. Remove installed programs using "sudo make uninstall".
3. Remove all package files using "rm -r *".

Note: 'make' is assumed to be the GNU make command (often available
      under the name 'gmake'). Also, gcc is assumed to be the system
      default compiler. On BSD systems, this may be clang. If so,
      replace 'gcc' with 'clang' in the top level make.def file.
