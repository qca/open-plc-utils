.SH NAME
plcotst - PLC One-Time Self-Test Manager

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR plcotst 
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ device ] 
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Manage the PLC One-Time Self-Test feature on Atheros powerline devices.
Normally, selftest is performed once, on startup at the factory, but it can also be configured and run again using this utility.
Selftest results are stored by the firmware and can be read using this utility, as well.
The selftest is configured when configuration options are specified on the command line; otherwise, selftest results are read or cleared.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS
.Tp
-\fBc\fI version\fR
Configuration version number.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR.
This option applies to both selftest configuration and selftest results.

.TP
.RB - C
Clear stored selftest results.
This option clears stored selftest results.
This option implies selftest results and supersedes options \fB-d\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-m\fR, \fB-r\fR and \fB-R\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
-\fBd\fI seconds\fR
Delay selftest after reboot.
Permitted delay times are \fB0\fR through \fBUINT_MAX\fR seconds.
The default is \fB0\fR seconds.
This option implies selftest configuration and supersedes option \fB-C\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBf\fI count\fR
Run the flash memory selftest \fIcount\fR times.
Valid values are \fB0\fR through \fBUINT_MAX\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR which effectively suppresses the test.
This option implies selftest configuration and supersedes option \fB-C\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
-\fBm\fI count\fR
Run the memory selftest \fIcount\fR times.
Valid values are \fB0\fR through \fBUINT_MAX\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR which suppresses effectively the test.
This option implies selftest configuration and supersedes option \fB-C\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
-\fBr\fI flag\fR
Run selftest after reboot.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR.
Expected values are \fB0\fR for \fBfalse\fR and \fB1\fR for \fBtrue\fR.
The default is \fB1\fR.
If the memory test \fIcount\fR and flash test \fIcount\fR are both \fB0\fR no testing will occur when the time comes.
This option implies selftest configuration and supersedes option \fB-C\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
-\fBR\fI flag\fR
Reset device after selftest.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR.
Expected values are \fB0\fR for \fBfalse\fR and \fB1\fR for \fBtrue\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR.
This option applies to selftest configuration only and supersedes option \fB-C\fR, if present on the command line.

.TP
-\fBt \fItimeout\fR
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

.TP
.RB - v
Print additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR device
The Ethernet hardware address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified on the command line.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is \fBlocal\fR.
as explained in the \fBDEVICES\fR section.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example prints stored test results for the local device on stdout because no options are specified on the command line.

.PP
   # plcotst  

.PP
The next example prints stored test results for remote device \fB00:B0:52:BA:BE:DE\fR and clears them afterwards.

.PP
   # plcotst -C

.PP
The next example configures the PLC selftest to wait \fB5\fR seconds before execution because option \fB-d\fR is present.
It also configures the selftest to reset the device after execution because option \fB-R\fR is present

.PP
   # plcotst -d 5 -R
