.SH NAME
plcmdio16 - Qualcomm Atheros 16-bit MDIO Register Editor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR plcmdio16
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ device ]
.RI [ device ]
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read or write generic MDIO registers using the Qualcomm Atheros VS_MDIO_COMMAND vendor-specific management message.
The default operation is to read a register.
Registers are written only if data is specified on the command line.
This program replaces program \fBint6kmdio\fR.

.PP
This program writes MDIO instructions using \fB802.3 Clause 22\fR (\fIphy\fR, \fIreg\fR, \fIdata\fR and \fImask\fR) format.
See program \fBplcmdio162\fR for a similar program to write instructions using \fB802.3ae Clause 45\fR (\fIaddress\fR, \fIdata\fR and \fImask\fR) format.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
It replaces legacy program \fBint6kmdio\fR.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBd \fIdata\fR
A 16-bit data value to be inserted into the specified register.
The specified data value is written when this option is present; otherwise the specified register is read and the content is displayed.
Data values may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.
Hexadecimal values are prefixed with "0x" or "0X".
Binary values are prefixed with "0b" or "0B".

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; 
however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
-\fBp \fIaddress\fR
The 5-bit PHY address.
Some devices may not support all possible addresses.
Addresses may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.
Hexadecimal values must be prefixed with "0x" or "0X".
Binary values must be prefixed with "0b" or "0B".

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
-\fBr \fIregister\fR
The 5-bit register address.
Addresses may be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal or binary notation.
Hexadecimal values must be prefixed with "0x" or "0X".
Binary values must be prefixed with "0b" or "0B".
Some devices may not support all possible addresses.

.TP
.RB - v
Prints additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet packets on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help   
Displays program help information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except version information.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Displays program version information on stderr.
This option takes precedence over all other options on the command line except help information.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros technical staff.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR device
The MAC address of some powerline device.
More than one address may be specified.
If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
The default address is \fBlocal\fR.
See \fBDEVICES\fR for information about symbolic device addresses.

.SH DEVICES
Powerline devices use Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
A MAC address is a 48-bit value entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.
Octets may be separated with colons for clarity.
For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and equivalent.

.PP
The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

.TP
.BR all
Same as "broadcast".

.TP
.BR broadcast
A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address, \fBFF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF\fR.
All devices, whether local, remote or foreign recognize messages sent to this address.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

.TP
.BR local
A synonym for the Qualcomm Atheros vendor specific Local Management Address (LMA), \fB00:B0:52:00:00:01\fR.
All local Atheros devices recognize this address but remote and foreign devices do not.
A remote device is any device at the far end of a powerline connection.
A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
