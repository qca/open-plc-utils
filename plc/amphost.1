.SH DESCRIPTION
Wait for VS_HST_ACTION.IND messages from a local device and service them as described in the QCA Firmware Technical Reference Manual.
This program can be used to demonstrate or verify proper powerline device/host interaction for flash-less devices.
This implementation is not production grade and will stop dead - like a bug! - when things go wrong.
Consider using the Qualcomm Atheros Embedded API for real-time, production-grade applications.

.PP
Host emulation applies to flash-less device designs where a local host processor provides the persistent storage.
The local host can provide a wide range of intelligent storage functions for a device but this program offers one.
Options -\fBN\fR and -\fBP\fR name existing files that store the factory default runtime firmware and parameters, respectively.
Options -\fBn\fR and -\fBp\fR name scratch files that will store user firmware and parameters, respectively.
This is similar to the standard Atheros NVRAM scheme but is not the same.

.PP
To use the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this program with the correct filenames.
The program will automatically respond to device requests to download memory configuration, firmware and/or parameters and upload firmware or and/or parameters under device control.
See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBF\fR[\fBF\fR]
Flash NVRAM once downloaded firmware has started.
The same firmware and PIB are downloaded, again, using VS_WR_MOD and written to NVRAM using VS_MOD_NVM.
Adding a second \fBF\fR here or another -\fBF\fR anywhere on the command line will perform a forced flash.
When no NVRAM is present, normal and force flash cause the device to upload to the host.
When blank or corrupted NVRAM is present, forced flash writes to NVRAM.
This operation will fail when no NVRAM is present.

.TP
\fB\-i \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only responses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP 
-\fBN \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to download firmware when requested by the local device.
The file must exist and have a valid NVM file format or it will be rejected.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
The program will not over-write this file.
This option and argument are required.

.TP
-\fBn \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to store firmware uploaded from the local device.
The file need not exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.
If firmware is uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent firmware downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.
In that case, the file specified by option -\fBN\fR is used.
This option and argument are optional.
If omitted then the default filename \fBuser.pib\fR will be used.

.TP
-\fBP \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to download parameters when requested by the local device.
The file must exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be rejected.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
The program will not over-write this file.
This option and argument are required.

.TP
-\fBp \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device.
The file need not exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.
Once parameters are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent parameter downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.
In that case, the file specified by option -\fBP\fR is used.
This option and argument are optional.
If omitted then the default filename \fBuser.nvm\fR will be used.

.TP
-\fBq\fP
Suppress status messages on stderr.

.TP
-\fBt \fImilliseconds\fR
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

.TP
-\fBv\fP
Print additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option will print incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames on stdout.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS
None.

.SH REFERENCES
See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command starts the host emulator.
The -\fBN\fR and -\fBP\fR options are always required.
Their order is not important.
