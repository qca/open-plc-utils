.SH NAME
CMEncrypt - Send Encrypted Payload

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR CMEncrypt
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ device ] 
.RI [ ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Transmit a file over powerline using CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD messages.
This program tests and demonstrates proper (or improper) message routing but does not support encrypted transmission.
All payloads are sent unencrypted at this time.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBA\fI status\fR
The AVLN Status.
This indicates the current association status and capabilities of the sending station.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR but only value 0 through 5 and 8 are recognized by the firmware.
Values may be entered in decimal, hexadecimal or binary format.
Hexadecimal value are prefixed with "\fB0x\fR" or "\fB0X\fR".
Binary values are prefixed with "\fB0b\fR" or "\fB0B\fR".
The default is \fB0\fR.

.TP
-\fBf\fI file\fR
The name of the payload file.
File content may be text or binary and forms the payload of one or more messages.
Payloads are transmitted unencrypted when PID is 4 and PEKS is 15 which is default.

.TP
-\fBK \fIPEKS\fR
The Payload Encryption Key Select.
This value indicates the key used to encrypt the payload.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB15\fR.
Values may be entered in decimal, hexadecimal or binary format.
Hexadecimal value are prefixed with "\fB0x\fR" or "\fB0X\fR".
Binary values are prefixed with "\fB0b\fR" or "\fB0B\fR"..
The default is \fB15\fR for "No Encryption".

.TP
-\fBP \fIPID\fR
The Protocol Identifier.
This value determines how the payload is interpreted by powerline devices.
Permitted values are \fB0\fR through \fB4\fR.
The default is \fB4\fR for "HLE Protocol".

.TP
-\fBv\fR
Print incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames in hex dump format on stdout.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fIdevice\fR
The Media Access Control (MAC) address of a remote host, not a powerline device.
Addresses are 6 hexadecimal octets optionally separated by colon.
For example, the addresses "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are all valid and equivalent.
For convenience, the symbolic address "\fBlocal\fR" resolves to "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and the symbolic addresses "\fBall\fR" and "\fBbroadcast\fR" both resolve to "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff".

.SH INTERNALS
This program lets the user specify some CM_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD fields but not others.
The following are fields that the user cannot specify.
The program automatically computes these values.

.TP
.BR PRN
The Protocol Run Number.
This is a random number used to distinguish between runs having the same protocol.
This program uses the system time variable.

.TP
.BR UUID
The Universally Unique Identifier.
This program uses the left-most 16 bytes of the SHA256 digest for the payload.

.SH REFERENCES
Consult the \fIHomePlug AV Specification\fR or \fIAtheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual\fR for more information.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example transmits file \fBmyfile.txt\fR to host \fB00:85:73:00:94:01\fR in unecrypted format because that is the program default.
The remote address is required and refers to the ultimate recipient, not the local device.

.PP
   # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt 00:85:73:00:94:01
The next example does the same but specifies the program defaults.
Observe that operands can be expressed in decimal, binary or hexadecimal format.

.PP
   # CMEncrypt -f myfile.txt -A 0 -P 0b0100 -K 0x0F 00:85:73:00:94:01
