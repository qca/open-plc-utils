 *   Read the PIB Image from an INT6000 using as many VS_RD_MOD
 *   messages as needed; Write image blocks to file as they are
 *   read;
 *
 *   the objective here is to read the PIB module in 1024 byte blocks
 *   until the module offset equals or exceeds the PIB length; we do
 *   not know the PIB length until we have read the header contained
 *   in the first block at OFFSET 0;
 *
 *   MOFFSET and MLENGTH fields occupy different offsets in REQ and CNF
 *   messages; we exploit that by initializing them using CNF message
 *   offsets then copying values into REQ message offsets before each
 *   read; this works because confirmation messages always return all
 *   the data we request or nothing at all;
