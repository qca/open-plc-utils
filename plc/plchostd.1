.TH plchostd 1 "April 2013" "plc-utils-2.1.5" "Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit"

.SH NAME
plchostd - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Host Daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR plchostd
.RB [ options ] 
.BR -N 
.IR nvmfile 
.BR -P 
.IR pibfile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Wait for VS_HST_ACTION.IND messages from a local device and service them as described in the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for powerline devices.
Unlike programs \fBint6khost\fR and \fBint64host\fR, this program uses operating system features available on POSIX, Unix, BSD and Linux systems but not available on Microsoft or VxWorks systems.

.PP
To use the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this program with the correct filenames.
The program will automatically respond to device requests to download memory configuration, firmware and/or parameters and upload firmware or and/or parameters under device control.
See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-i \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this interface and only responses received via this interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP 
-\fBN \fInvmfile\fR
The file containing the firmware chain used to boot and flash the device.
The file must exist and have a valid NVM file format or it will be rejected.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
The program will not over-write this file.
This option and argument are required.

.TP
-\fBn \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to store firmware uploaded from the local device.
The file need not exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.
If firmware is uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent firmware downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.
In that case, the file specified by option -\fBN\fR is used.
This option and argument are optional.
If omitted then the default filename \fBhost.pib\fR will be used.

.TP
-\fBP \fIpibfile\fR
The file containing the parameter chain used to boot and flash the device.
The file must exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be rejected.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
The program will not over-write this file.
This option and argument are required.

.TP
-\fBp \fIfilename\fR
Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device.
The file need not exist but an error will occur if it cannot be created or written.
Once parameters are uploaded to this file, it is used for subsequent parameter downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.
In that case, the file specified by option -\fBP\fR is used.
This option and argument are optional.
If omitted then the default filename \fBhost.nvm\fR will be used.

.TP
-\fBq\fP
Suppress status messages on stderr.

.TP
-\fBs \fIpathname\fR
The server socket pathname.
Automatically open this Unix socket and post event information to it for the benefit of other host processes.

.TP
-\fBS \fIfilename\fR
The file containing the softloader chain used to flash the device.
The presence of this file causes the device to be flashed once it has booted.
The file must exist and have a valid PIB file format or it will be rejected.
No assumptions are made based on filename and no filename conventions are enforced.
The program will not over-write this file.
This option and argument are required.

.TP
-\fBt \fItimeout\fR
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

.TP
-\fBv\fP
Print additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option will print incoming and outgoing Ethernet frames on stdout.

.TP
-\fBw \fIwakeup\fR
Wakeup time in seconds.
If no VS_HST_ACTION.IND message is received within this time period then the process will wakeup and perform periodic functions such as posting network topography to the server socket specified by option \fB-s\fR.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS
None.

.SH REFERENCES
See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example starts the host server.
The -\fBN\fR and -\fBP\fR options are always required.
Option order is not important.
Control does not return to the console until the program is terminated by the user using CTRL-C or another command line interrupt.

.PP
   # plchostd -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib

.PP
The next example does the same but spawns the program as an independent process and returns control to the console.
In this case, that process must be terminated or killed using an appropriate command such ad \fBkill\fR.

.PP
   # plchostd -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib -d
