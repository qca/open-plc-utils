where \fIcondition\fR is a \fIfield\fR \fIoperator\fR \fIvalue\fR sequence.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Format and send stream classification rules to one or more devices.
Rules specify an action to be taken when a frame satisfies selection criteria.
Selection criteria consists of one, two or three conditions where any or all conditions must be satisfied.
Each condition consists of a field type, a relational operator and a value.
Rules may be added to a device, or removed from a device, so that they have permanent or temporary effect.

.PP
Classification rules are cumulative.
If a new rule set is identical to an old rule set then an error will occur unless it contains a different Transmission Action.
In that case the old rule will be replaced.
Identical classification rule sets are permitted if one of the sets is associated with a VLAN tag action.
Classification is based on the original frame before is is altered by VLAN Tag insertion or removal.

.PP
Classification is multi-dimensional and the terminology used here may seem strange at first.
Refer to the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Techncial Reference Manual description of the VS_CLASSIFICATION management message for a full explanation.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.RB - e
Redirects stderr messages to stdout.
By convention status and error messages are printed on stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.
This option prints all output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

.TP
-\fBi\fR \fIinterface\fR
Select the host Ethernet interface.
All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via this host interface are recognized.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR because most people use \fBeth0\fR as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.
This option then takes precedence over either default.

.TP
.RB - q
Suppresses status messages on stderr.

.TP
.RB - s
Print a list of program keywords on stdout.
This option over-rides all others, except \fB-?\fR and \fB-!\fR, and the program will terminate without further action.

.TP
-\fBt \fImilliseconds\fR

.TP
Read timeout in milliseconds.
Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.
This is the maximum time allowed for a response.
The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.
-\fBT \fItag\fR
The VLAN tag to be inserted into frames before they are transmitted.
The tag is a 32-bit hexadecimal integer with optional "\fB0x\fR" prefix.
This option is required for action \fBTagTX\fR and must be omitted for all other actions.

.TP
.RB - v
Print additional information on stdout.
In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

.TP
-\fBV \fIversion\fR
The CSPEC version number expressed as a small decimal integer.
This option is required (and should be \fB2\fR) for action \fBTagTX\fR and must be omitted for all other actions.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.PP    
.B  Ethernet Address Rules

.PP
Ethernet address rules have the following general format:

.PP 
   | CAP0 | ANY | EthSA | IS  | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
   | CAP1 | ALL | EthDA | NOT |                   | REMOVE | PERM |
   | CAP2 |
   | CAP3 |
   | DROP |

.PP 
For example, instruct device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF to temporarily add a rule to forward frames from 00:2B:FE:CA:FE:BA at CAP3.
Observe Ethernet hardware addresses are used both in the condition and for the affected powerline devices.

.PP 
   # plcrule cap3 any ethsa is 00:2b:fe:ca:fe:ba add temp 00:b0;52:ba:be:ff

.PP
.B IP Address Rules

.PP
IP address rules have the following general format:

.PP 
   | CAP0 | ANY | IPv4SA | IS  | ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
   | CAP1 | ALL | IPv4DA | NOT |                 | REMOVE | PERM |
   | CAP2 |
   | CAP3 |
   | DROP |
 

.PP
For example, instruct device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF to permanently remove the rule that drops packets from 192.168.99.1.
Notice that the IP address is specified in dotted decimal format but the device address is specified in hexadecimal octet format.
Dotted decimal format permits empty and variable length octets but octet delimitors are mandatory.
Hexadecimal octet format requires fixed length octets but octet delimiters are optional.

.PP 
   # plcrule drop any ipv4sa is 192.168.99.1 remove perm 00:b0:52:ba:be:ff

.PP
.B IP Protocol Rules

.PP
IP protocol rules have the following general format:

.PP 
   | CAP0 | ANY | IPv4PROT | IS  | xxxx | ADD    | TEMP | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
   | CAP1 | ALL |          | NOT |      | REMOVE | PERM |
   | CAP2 |
   | CAP3 |
   | DROP |

.PP 
For example, to instruct device 00:B0:52:BA:BE:FF to permanently add a rule to forward non-IP packets at CAP2.
In this example, delmiters have been omitted from the device Ethernet address.

.PP 
   # plcrule CAP2 all ipv4prot not 0x0800 add perm 00b052babeff
