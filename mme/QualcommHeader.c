 *   having HomePlug message protocol version (INTELLON_MMV) and
 *   Atheros message type (MMTYPE);
 *
 *   return the number of bytes actually encoded or 0 on encode error;

 *   be used;

 *   OUI is the Organizationally Unique Identifier resgistered with

 *   to flush the buffer before calling this function;
