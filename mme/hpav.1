.SH NAME
hpav - HomePlug AV Packet Listener

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR hpav 
.RI [ options ] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
Display HomePlug AV Ethernet messages sent by a local powerline device to the host or the broadcast address.
Do not display HomePlug AV frames sent from the host to powerline devices or forwarded over powerline through the local powerline devices.

.PP
The program is an example of a simple packet listener and daemon.
Engineers and software developers can extend it to build custom sniffers or servers.
The framework is present but additional features must be added.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBplc\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
Names the host ethernet interface to watch.
The named interface, such as eth0, eth1 and so on, must be connected to a HomePlug AV ethernet-to-powerline bridge adapter to receive any HomePlug AV traffic.
The default interface is \fBeth1\fR.

.TP
.RB - q
Quiet mode.
Suppress the printing of the normal message descriptions on \fBstdout\fR.

.TP
.RB - v
Verbose mode.
Displays incoming frames in hexadecimal dump format on \fBstdout\fR.
This option is independent of option \fB-a\fR which prints VS_ARPC message text on stderr.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
See the HomePlug AV Specification for a description of all HomePlug AV message types.
See the Qualcomm Atheros INT6000 Firmware Reference Manual for a description of Atheros Vendor Specific message types.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command monitors the default host interface \fBeth1\fR for HomePlug AV traffic and dumps detected frames on the console as they arrive.
To terminate the process, type \fB^C\fR or \fB^Z\fR at the console.
This program is usually run in a separate console window while performing powerline operations.

.PP
   # hpav

.PP
The following command monitors host interface \fBeth4\fR for incoming HomePlug AV frames and dumps writes them to file \fBhpav.log\fR.
Frames are printed in hexadecimal dump format because option \fB-v\fR is present.
Terminate the foreground process by typing ^C or ^Z at the console.

.PP
   # hpav -v -i eth4 > hpav.log
