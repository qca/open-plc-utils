.TH config2cfg 1 "April 2013" "plc-utils-2.1.5" "Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit"

.SH NAME
config2cfg \- Atheros Configuration File Converter

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconfig2cfg\fR [\fBoptions\fR] \fBfile\fR [\fBfile\fR] [\fB...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBconfig2cfg\fR program converts an SDRAM configuration file used by the Windows Device Manager to the configuration file format used by the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

.P
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS
There are no options.

.SH EXPLANATION
The Windows Device Manager format consists of 64 ASCII hexadecimal characters.
Files usually have a \fB.config\fR extension.
File size is at least 64 characters.
Excess characters are ignored in input.
This means that files can be modified using any text editor and there is no way to detect modification.
From a programming standpoint, ASCII-to-binary conversion and checksum computation is required on input and binary-to-ASCII conversion is required on output.

.PP
The Atheros Powerline Toolkit format consists of 32 binary bytes plus a 4 byte (32 bit) checksum.
Files usually have a \fB.cfg\fR extension.
File size is always 36 characters.
The files can be edited using any hex editor but a new checksum must be computed and inserted after any change.
No conversion or computation is required on input or output.
Input is ready for direct insertion into a VS_SET_SDRAM message.

.PP
Programs \fBint6k\fR and \fBint6kf\fR expect this latter format and so you can use this program determine if a given file has the proper format.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fIfile\fR
The filename of a Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration file.
The file is re-written such that the filename is preserved but the contents are not.
Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration files usually have a \fB.config\fR extension but the program makes no assumption based on filename and does not enforce any filename conventions.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Suppresses printing of progress messages.
There are no progress messages in this version.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Print additional information.
There is no additional information printed in this version.

.TP
-\fB?\fR, --\fBhelp\fR
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
-\fB!\fR, --\fBversion\fR
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example reads file abc.cfg and validates it.
The message shown indicates that the configuration file is the correct size and has a checksums and there are no read errors.

.P
    > chkcfg abc.cfg
    chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good

.P
The following example reads three files in succession and reports on each one.
You can suppress good news with the \fB-q\fR option.

.P
    # chkcfg abc.cfg def.cfg ghi.cfg
    chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
    chkcfg: def.cfg is corrupt
    chkcfg: ghi.cfg looks good

.P
The following example displays the SDRAM configuration values in all files having names that match the wildcard pattern \fBsdram*.cfg\fR.
We can confirm that the values inside are correct for their filenames.
Program output could have been sent to a file and saved for later reference.

.P
    # chknvm -qv sdram*.cfg
    ------- sdram32.cfg -------
            SIZE=0x02000000 (32mb)
            CONF=0x00143188
            TIM0=0x01E1D491
            TIM1=0x000883D6
            CNTRL=0x00003089
            REF=0x00000366
            CLOCK=0x00000001
    ------- sdram16.cfg -------
            SIZE=0x01000000 (16mb)
            CONF=0x00142F68
            TIM0=0x0115124E
            TIM1=0x000883D6
            CNTRL=0x00003089
            REF=0x00000493
            CLOCK=0x00000001
