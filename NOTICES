MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 2010 PROFESSIONAL AND TRIAL EDITION

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT. If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country for information about Microsoft's refund policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call (800) MICROSOFT or see www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm.

AS DESCRIBED BELOW, USING SOME FEATURES ALSO OPERATES AS YOUR CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN STANDARD COMPUTER INFORMATION FOR INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.

TRIAL USE RIGHTS and CONVERSION for Visual Studio 2010 Professional Trial Edition. If the software is a trial edition, then this Section applies to you. You may install and use any number of copies of the trial software on your devices. You may only use the trial software for internal evaluation purposes. For example, your trial rights do not include the right to deploy or distribute any programs you design or develop with the software for use in a production environment, except that you may deploy your programs internally solely to evaluate the software. You may convert your trial rights at any time to the full rights described in the rest of these license terms by purchasing a commercial license and obtaining a product key from Microsoft or one of its distributors. Your rights to use the trial software are limited to ninety (90) days. The trial software will present conversion options to you thirty (30) days after you install the trial software. At that time you may either request an additional 60-day trial period extension or purchase a commercial license to continue using the software. After the expiration of the 90-day trial period, without conversion, the trial software will stop running.

	- Sections 1-3, 10 - 13, 15, 16, 19 and Limited Warranty do not apply. The remaining sections below apply.
	- Disclaimer of Warranty. The software is licensed "as-is". You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
	- Because this software is "as is", we may not provide support services for it.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

The software may contain the jQuery javascript library and the jQuery validation javascript library, which is licensed under the MIT License. For a copy of that license please see www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php. We do not claim to ‚Äúown‚Äù jQuery or jQuery Validation. While we offer our regular support options for the rest of the Microsoft software, the support we offer for jQuery and jQuery Validation will be as follows:

	- Support is for the particular jQuery and jQuery Validation code that is included in the software, and only for requests from users of the software.
	- We will take in customer inquiries. We will, at our option, submit bug fixes to the jQuery or jQuery Validation team on behalf of our customers.
	- Support does not include feature requests. For feature requests, we will direct you to contact the jQuery or jQuery Validation team directly.
	- Support does not include distribution of fixes broadly, such as via a Service Level Agreement. We may, however, provide targeted fixes to our customers on a case-by-case basis or suggest a fix so that customers can apply it at their own discretion.
	- If jQuery or jQuery Validation is discontinued as an ongoing project, then our ability to support it will also need to end at that time. We may also choose to discontinue this support for any other reason.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

17. APPLICABLE LAW.

If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

It also applies even if repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or ∑ Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental EULA and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable OS Product EULA. 

General. Each of the OS Components available from this site is identified as being applicable to one or more of the OS Products. The applicable OS Components are provided to you by Microsoft to update, supplement, or replace existing functionality of the applicable OS Product. Microsoft grants you a license to use the applicable OS Components under the terms and conditions of the EULA for the applicable OS Product (which are hereby incorporated by reference except as set forth below), the terms and conditions set forth in this Supplemental EULA, and the terms and conditions of any additional end user license agreement that may accompany the individual OS Components (each an "Individual EULA"), provided that you comply with all such terms and conditions. To the extent that there is a conflict among any of these terms and conditions applicable to the OS Components, the following hierarchy shall apply: 1) the terms and conditions of the Individual EULA; 2) the terms and conditions in this Supplemental EULA; and 3) the terms and conditions of the applicable OS Product EULA. 

Additional Rights and Limitations. 
If you have multiple validly licensed copies of any OS Product, you may reproduce, install and use one copy of the applicable OS Components as part of the applicable OS Product on all of your computers running validly licensed copies of the applicable OS Product, provided that you use such additional copies of such OS Components in accordance with the terms and conditions above.

Microsoft retains all right, title and interest in and to the OS Components. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Microsoft. 

If you are installing the OS Components on behalf of an organization other than your own, prior to installing any of the OS Components, you must confirm that the end-user (whether an individual or a single entity) has received, read and accepted these terms and conditions. 

The OS Components may contain technology that enables applications to be shared between two or more computers, even if an application is installed on only one of the computers. You may use this technology with all Microsoft application products for multi-party conferences. For non-Microsoft applications, you should consult the accompanying license agreement or contact the licensor to determine whether application sharing is permitted by the licensor. 

You may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Framework component of the OS Components (".NET Component").  You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you comply with the following terms: (1) you must disclose all the information necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test scripts/cases, tuning parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any third party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s); (2) you must disclose the date(s) that you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all Microsoft software products tested, including the .NET Component; (3) your benchmark testing was performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft operating system; (4) it shall be sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available location such as a website, so long as every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the public site containing all required disclosures; and (5) nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that you may have to conduct benchmark testing.  The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the results of any customized benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under confidentiality in conjunction with a bid request by a prospective customer, such customer's application(s) are specifically tested and the results are only disclosed to such specific customer.  Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same conditions above.
