.SH NAME
edsu - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet II Data Send Utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR edsu
.RI [ options ]
.IR file
.RI [ file ]
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Send one or more files as a series of Ethernet II (IEEE 802.2) frames.
Input files are sequentially read and sent over network as a continuous stream of standard Ethernet frames.
All frames (except perhaps the last frame for each file) will contain 1500 bytes of file data.
The receiving host may elect to concatenate frame data as frames arrive.

.PP
This program can be used to test remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline devices.
The remote UART-enabled powerline device will remove frame headers and forward frame data to the local host as a serial data stream.
No protocol is imposed on the serial data stream.
For example, there is no indication of frame or file start or end within the stream.
The remote powerline device must be in \fBTransparent Mode\fR and configured to accept frames from the sending host.
The remote host must also be ready to handle serial data as it arrives.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBd \fIxx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\fR
The Ethernet address of the destination device.
If the destination device is a Linux, Mac OSX or Windows host then program \fBedru\fR can be used to receive and write frame data to \fBstdout\fR as a serial stream.
If the destination device is an Atheros UART-enabled powerline device then received frame data will be converted to a serial data stream and forwarded to the host connected to that device.
In that case, the UART-enabled powerline device must be programmed with the address of the sending host.

.TP
-\fBe \fIethertype\fR
The protocol (or ethertype) of interest expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal integer.
Prefix "\fB0x\fR" is optional.
This filters out frames having any other ethertype.
The default is \fBETH_P_802_2\fR as defined in \fBif_ether.h\fR.

.TP
-\fBi \fIinterface\fR
The host interface used to send frames.
The program default is "\fBeth1\fR" on Linux, "\fBen0\fR" on MacOSX or OpenBSD and "\fB2\fR" on Windows; however, if environment string "\fBPLC\fR" is defined, it supersedes the program default.
Any  interface specified on the command line supersedes all others.

.TP
-\fBp \fIseconds\fR
Pause time in seconds between sending each frame.
Pauses may be necessary when the destination device is a UART-enabled powerline device because each frame must be converted and transmitted serially from the remote device to the remote host.
Permitted pause times are \fB0\fR through \fB255\fR seconds.
The default is \fB0\fR.

.TP
.RB - q
Quiet mode.
This option has no effect at this time.

.TP
.RB - v
Verbose mode.
This option displays outgoing frames on stdout in hexadecimal dump format as they are sent.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of a text or binary file accessible from the local host.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example sends files \fBabc.txt\fR then \fBdef.bin\fR to the remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline device \fB00:B0:52:BA:BE:55\fR over network interface \fBeth1\fR.
There is a constant 1 second delay between each frame sent so that remote UART-enabled powerline devices have time to convert and forward each frame to their local host.
