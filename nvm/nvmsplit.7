.SH NAME
nvmsplit - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Firmware Image File Slicer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR nvmsplit
.RI [ options ]
.IR file
.RI [ file ]
[...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Extract all images from an Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact.
Extracted images appear in files having the input file basename with sequence numbers indicating the relative position of the image within the original file.
For example, image file \fBabc.nvm\fR might result in files \fBabc-00.nvm\fR, \fBabc-01.nvm\fR, \fBabc-02.nvm\fR and so on.
Each output file is a valid, single-image file and so they can be combined using program \fBnvmmerge\fR.

.PP
Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.
Image blocks can contain data, applets or programs.
Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute based on information in the image headers.
Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual obligations made by Atheros.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH OPTIONS

Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of an Atheros image file.
By convention, Atheros Image files have a \fB.nvm\fR file extension but this program does not enforce this convention.
Invalid image files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example reads Atheros image file \fBabc.nvm\fR and creates one or more output files.
Each file contains one image with associated header.

.PP
   # nvmsplit abc.nvm -v
   nvmsplit: abc.nvm --> abc-00.nvm
   nvmsplit: abc.nvm --> abc-01.nvm
   nvmsplit: abc.nvm --> abc-02.nvm
   nvmsplit: abc.nvm --> abc-03.nvm
