.SH NAME
pib2xml - print object driven xml editior intructions 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR pib2xml 
.RI [ options ]
.IR file 
.RI [ file ]
.RI [ ... ] 
.RI [> stdout ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Write XML editor instructions on stdout.
This requires an object definition file that contains the size and name of data regions and members within a binary object or file.
Individual data members are presented as XML instructions that can be used by program \fBpxe\fR to edit PIB files.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBf\fI definitions\fR
The name of the object definition file that contains the size, name and description of objects within a binary file.
The definition file is not modified.
This option is required.
There is no default file.

.TP
-\fBs\fI schema\fR
The url for the XML schema.
The default schema is \fBpiboffset.xsd\fR for the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit verion of this program.

.TP
.RB - x
Print an XML schema on stdout.
This schema defines the elements and attributes used to define data objects and members read from input files.
It can be used to validate XML files used with program \fBpxe\fR.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of a binary file.
The file must have either Thunderbolt/Lightning or Panther/Lynx format or output will be incorrect.
The file is not modified by this program.
Only one such file is permitted on the command line.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example object definition file that defines a standard ethernet frame and member fields within it.
The comments and descriptions shown are optional.
The field lengths and field names are not.
Zero-length fields denote arbitrary field groups and are used by program \fBoffset\fR to print headings.

.PP
The following command uses object definition file \fBether.txt\fR to identify and display member fields within binary file \fBabc.bin\fR as a set of xml instructions that can be used by program \fBxde\fR to edit other files.

.PP
   # pib2xml -f ether.txt abc.bin

.PP
The next command writes the xml schema that defines the elements and attributes used in the edit instructions to file \fBdata.xsd\fR.
This file can be used to validate xml edit instructions.

.PP
   # pib2xml -x > data.xsd
