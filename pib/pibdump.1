.SH NAME
pibdump - Qualcomm Atheros Parameter Information Block Dump Utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR pibdump 
.RI [ options ]
.IR file 
.RI [> stdout ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a Qualcomm Atheros powerline parameter information block (PIB) file and print an object driven dump on stdout.
This program replaces program \fBodd\fR because it distinguishes between legacy and current PIB file formats.

.PP
An object driven dump requires an object definition file that lists the size and name of data objects (ie; integers, arrays or structures) within the parameter file.
Individual data members are presented as smaller, individual data dumps within a larger, overall data dump.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBf\fI file\fR
The object definition file that lists the size, name and description of individual individual objects in order of occurance.
If this option is omitted then object definitions are read from stdin.
The object definition file is not modified by this program.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of a binary file.
The file must have either Thunderbolt/Lightning or Panther/Lynx format or output will be incorrect.
The file is not modified by this program.
Only one such file is permitted on the command line.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example object definition file for an Ethernet frame.
Frame fields, like \fBODA\fR, \fBOSA\fR and \fBETHTYPE\fR,  are defined by \fIlength\fR in order of their appears in the frame.
Array subscripts following object names are optional but, if present, become part of the object name.
Fields having no \fIlength\fR are headers and will be ignored.
Comments and blank lines are also ignored.

The following command uses object definition file \fBether.txt\fR to identify and display member fields within binary file \fBabc.bin\fR in hexadecimal dump format.

   # pibdump -f ether.txt abc.bin
