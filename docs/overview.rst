Introduction
============

The :program:`Open Powerline Toolkit` (vanilla version) may be downloaded from `https://github.com/qca/open-plc-utils.git <None>`_ by any interested party. An advanced version (chocolate version) may be downloaded from the Qualcomm Atheros Customer FTP site by parties having permission to do so. The chocolate version includes special programs that perform advanced engineering, production and maintenance tasks. Within this document, we refer to both versions, collectively, as "the toolkit".

The toolkit contains C Language source code and *GNU* makefiles to compile many useful programs. It also includes Linux shell scripts that use these programs, in various ways, to interrogate, control and manage Qualcomm Atheros *INT6000*, *INT6300*, *INT6400*, *AR7400* and later powerline devices. Qualcomm Atheros also provides a similar, but less extensive, toolkit for *INT5500* powerline devices.

The toolkit is intended for hardware engineers, verification engineers, field engineers and embedded software developers, consequently, programs are simple and compact. It is not intended for computer novices or retail users. Many customers embed a subset of toolkit programs in products for troubleshooting purposes.

The toolkit includes extensive HTML documentation and online man pages for users who cannot access installed man pages. HTML documentation starts with file `docbook/index.html <index.html>`_. Online man pages start with file `docbook/toolkit.html <toolkit.html>`_. Qualcomm Atheros recommends that you add these two pages to your browser favorites for later reference.

All toolkit programs are written in C and have command line intefaces. The source code essentially conforms to `ISO/IEC9899:1999 <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards.html#9899>`_. The source tree cleanly compiles using gcc or pcc on Ubuntu, OpenBSD and MacOSX. It also compiles under Microsoft C with the inclusion of special header files. The command line interface conforms to `*Section 12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines* <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_02>`_ of The Open Group Base Specification Issue 6 (`*IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition* <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/mindex.html>`_).

The toolkit includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET project files and solutions files to compile toolkit programs, plus the executable version (:file:`.exe`) of each program and a set of Microsoft installation file (:file:`.msi`) so that the toolkit package comes ready to install and run on any Windows host; however, Qualcomm Atheros does not provide support for Microsoft windows version of this toolkit. Toolkit documentation does provide Windows developers with special guidance on setting up their own Visual Studio projects and solutions, should they want to do that.

.. _overview-background:

Background
==========

HomePlug AV is an industry standard protocol for powerline communications developed by the `HomePlug Powerline Alliance <http://www.homeplug.org/home>`_. Qualcomm Atheros manufactures a family of chipsets that conform to that standard and have MII, UART and SPI host interfaces. The *INT6x00* and *AR7x00* series are flagship members of that chipset family. The principle difference between the chipsets is their boot method, cost and speed. The INT6000 requires onboard NVRAM but the *INT6300*, *INT6400* and *AR7400* do not.

The HomePlug AV protocol is based on IEEE-802.3, has ethertype ``0x88E1`` and uses special message formats. A subset of those message formats is reserved for each chipset vendor to define their own message formats. Qualcomm Atheros uses this vendor-specific subset to communicate between host processors and Qualcomm Atheros devices. This toolkit uses Qualcomm Atheros vendor-specific message formats to communicates with Qualcomm Atheros devices. It also understands Qualcomm Atheros firmware and configuration file formats.

This toolkit sends and receives Qualcomm Atheros vendor-specific messages but not generic HomePlug AV messages. Qualcomm Atheros vendor-specific management message formats are described in the Qualcomm Atheros *HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual*. If you do not have a copy of this document then you may request one from Qualcomm Atheros.

.. _overview-distribution:

Toolkit Distribution
====================

The Qualcomm Atheros :program:`Open Powerline Toolkit` is distributed using compressed tape archive files named :file:`open-plc-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz` and :file:`open-plc-utils-x.x.x.tar.bz2` and standard compressed archive file named :file:`open-plc-utils-x.x.x.zip`, where *x.x.x* is the version number. Archive files ending in :file:`.gz` can be decompressed with the Linux :program:`gzip` utility. Archive files ending in :file:`.bz2` can be decompressed with the Linux :program:`bzip2` utility. Archive files ending in :file:`.zip` can be decompressed using the Linux :program:`unzip` utility or the Windows :program:`WinZip` utility. The contents of decompressed archives can be extracted using the Linux :program:`tar` utility. Recent versions of the Linux :program:`tar` utility allow decompression and extraction in one operation. The :program:`WinZip` or :program:`7-zip` program may be used to decompress archives and extract contents on Microsoft Windows platforms.

Some Windows network administrators enable security software that removes :file:`.exe` and other executable files from :file:`.zip` archives in transit or in-situ. In that case, Windows user may want to download the :file:`*.tar.gz` archive and use a program like :program:`7zip` to unpack the archive file.

The toolkit includes source code, build scripts, documentation and pre-compiled programs for Microsoft Windows. Some third party libraries may also be included to support Microsoft platforms. Although the Microsoft Windows versions of toolkit programs are pre-compiled and ready-to-run, they are not supported because this package is designed for use on Linux platforms.

The Windows installer included in this version of the toolkit needs Microsoft .NET 1.1. Windows versions of toolkit programs that communicate with powerline devices need WinPcap 4.1.2 or later. A copy of Microsoft .NET 1.1 and WinPcap 4.1.2 is included in the :file:`support` folder.

.. _install-linux:

Toolkit Installation on Linux
=============================

The Linux version of the toolkit must be compiled from source code. The only requirement is the standard :program:`GNU/Linux` toolchain consisting of :program:`make`, :program:`gcc` and :program:`ld`. These are included with most :program:`Linux` distributions but may require installation. On *Debian* based distributions, such as *Ubuntu*, they may be installed using :program:`apt-get`. On *RedHat* distributions, such as *Fedora*, they may be installed using :program:`rpm`. On *SuSE* based distributions, they may be installed using :program:`YaST2`.

Toolkit Installation on GNU/*Linux*
-----------------------------------

Toolkit Installation on GNU/*Linux*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: console

    $ cp plc-utils-1.2.1.tar.gz /home/mydir
    $ cd /home/mydir
    $ tar -vzxf plc-utils-1.2.1.tar.gz
    $ cd plc-utils-1.2.1
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ make manuals

Decompress the archive and extract the contents with the :program:`tar` utility. This will create a folder having the same basename as the archive such that one version will not over-write another. Consult the :program:`tar` man page on your system for detailed instructions. Change directory to the appropriate folder.

The main package folder contains a recursive :file:`Makefile` that will compile and install all toolkit programs. If you do not want to compile and install all programs then change directory to the appropriate folder and run :program:`make` from there. To compile binary files, type ``make``. To install binary files, type ``make install``. To install man pages, type ``make manuals``. The package does not automatically install examples, scripts, applets or man pages.

We recommend that you :command:`login` as ``root`` user before installing the toolkit; otherwise, you will be prompted for the ``root`` password as each program or component is installed.

Programs are installed in folder :file:`/usr/local/bin` and man pages are installed in folders :file:`/usr/share/man/man1`. If these folders are not correct for your system, or if you want to install in other folders, then edit the folder names defined in the :ref:`make.def <software-cross-compile>` file found in main toolkit folder or over-ride these definitions in subordinate makefiles.

Toolkit Documentation on GNU/Linux
----------------------------------

Toolkit web pages are not automatically installed. To access toolkit documentation, point your browser to `docbook/index.html <index.html>`_ and add the page to the browser bookmark or favorites list. If you are interested in how the toolkit has been implemented then do the same for page `docbook/toolkit.html <toolkit.html>`_.

The method described above is only recommended if you do not plan to move or remove toolkit folders. Otherwise, you can merely copy the entire contents of the toolkit :file:`docbook` folder to another folder of your choice and point your browser to the new file locations.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cp -rv docbook/* /home/mydir/toolkit

Toolkit Removal on GNU/*Linux*
------------------------------

To uninstall installed programs and man pages on Linux, change to the main toolkit folder and type ``make uninstall``.

Toolkit Removal on GNU/*Linux*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /home/mydir/plc-utils-1.2.1
    $ sudo make uninstall

.. _install-macosx:

Toolkit Installation on Mac OS X
================================

Toolkit installation on *Mac OS X* is essentially identical to installation on Linux but special steps are needed before starting.

First, you must install the toolkit as the ``root`` user or you will be denied permission. The ``root`` user account is disabled by default and so you must enable it in order to login. Follow instructions at `Enabling the "root" user in Mac OS X <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1528>`_ to enable the account and login. After installation, toolkit programs should be run from a normal user account.

Second, *Mac OS X* does not include C Language development tools by default. You must download and install them in order to build the toolkit. You can download and install them from the Apple website or (if you are ambitious) download, compile and install them from various open source websites. Consider using `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/>`_ on :program:`Mac OS X Leopard` or :program:`Lion`.

Login as the root user and download or copy the toolkit archive file to your preferred folder then follow the :ref:`instructions <install-linux>` for installing the toolkit on Linux.

Setting the ``PATH`` variable on *OS X*
---------------------------------------

While still logged in as the ``root`` user, edit :file:`/etc/profile` and add folder :file:`/usr/local/bin` to the ``PATH`` definition found there. This will ensure that all users can access toolkit programs. The change may not take effect until the next time you login or open a new command shell.

.. code-block:: bash

    PATH="/bin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"

Installing the Toolkit on *Mac OS X*
------------------------------------

While still logged in as the ``root`` user, remember to delete the toolkit source folder or, at least change ownership of all files in the toolkit folder, so that you can access and/or remove them later.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ..
    $ rm -r plc-utils-x.x.x

.. _install-windows-xp:

Toolkit Installation on *Windows XP*
====================================

The *Windows* version of the toolkit comes pre-compiled and ready to install and run using the :program:`Windows Installer`. You may copy and distribute installation file :file:`plc-utils-x.x.x.msi`. Users may then click on the installation file to install the package then discard it afterwards. The installation file permits remote installation over the network.

The version of the Windows Installer used here needs Microsoft *.NET Framework 1.1* to work correctly. Newer versions of the *.NET Framework* will not work. The *.NET Framework* must be installed before the toolkit is installed or the *Windows Installer* will report dependency errors and refuse to complete installation. Multiple versions of the *.NET Framework* can coexist under *Windows 7*. The *.NET Framework* needed is included in the toolkit :file:`support` folder.

Windows versions of toolkit programs that communicate with powerline devices all need *WinPcap* from `winpcap.org <http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm>`_ to read and write Ethernet frames. *WinPcap* may be installed before or after toolkit installation but tools that access powerline devices will not run without it. You may want to install *WinPcap* before starting toolkit installation. If you have *Wireshark* installed then you probably already have *WinPcap* installed. A recent copy of *WinPcap* is included in the toolkit :file:`support` folder.

Failure to :ref:`remove previous toolkit versions <removal-windows-xp>` on some systems may result in the message "Another version of this product is already installed" when trying to install a new version. You may want to remove prior version before starting toolkit installation.

Obtaining the Toolkit
---------------------

QCA customers can download the toolkit from the QCA Customer FTP Site.

QCA employees may be able to download the toolkit from the QCA Application Engineering World FTP site ftp://appslinux01.qca.qualcomm.com/toolkit/plc-utils/.

.. _overview-programs:

Toolkit Programs
================

The Qualcomm Atheros :program:`Open Powerline Toolkit` is a collection of small, command line programs. Each program deals with some aspect of powerline device management. Programs can be combined, in various ways, using shell scripts, to perform sophisticated and complex tasks. With these program, one can identify chipset and firmware version, reset devices, flash devices, identify other powerline network devices, validate :file:`*.pib` and :file:`*.nvm` files, sniff HomePlug AV Ethernet frames, send generic Ethernet frames and so on.

Program source code is designed to demonstrate device hardware and firmware features and to illustrate techniques for software developers and hardware engineers. The source code may be modified and distributed without obligation to Qualcomm Atheros; however Qualcomm Atheros would appreciate feedback concerning improvements to program useability, reliability or efficiency. Keep in mind that these tools, unlike some other tools, are intended to be simple and compact.

Most programs in this toolkit start their life on Linux and are eventually ported to other environments. Consequently, not all programs are available in the Windows version of the toolkit but most of them are.

Program descriptions appear below in alphabetical order. Alternately, you may browse the latest program descriptions and source code `here <toolkit.html>`_.

.. _programs-6400-Management:

INT6400 Device Management
-------------------------

Programs in this group are older versions that communicate with INT6x00 chipsets. Many still work on AR7x00 chipsets. The main difference is due to the higher PHY data rates on AR7x00 chipsets. The higher data rates must be expressed using 16-bits instead of 8-bits. Consequently, some MME formats have changed.

.. _overview-folders:

Toolkit Folders
===============

The  Atheros  Open Powerline Toolkit package folder has many subfolders. Some contain source code, some contain documentation and others contain shell scripts. Some source folders contain programs that require components in neighboring folders. Consequently, you will see references to relative pathnames like ../folder, throughout source code, makefiles and shell scripts. This notation simplifies development and maintenance and is helpful when locating specific files.

Folder descriptions appear below in alphabetical order:

./docbook
    HTML pages generated by several methods, but mostly `Docbook 4.5 <http://www.docbook.org/>`_. Some pages have been created using special tools that are not provided and will not be made available. The :file:`Makefile` in this folder will compile the core XML source files on GNU/Linux systems that have :program:`Docbook 4.5` installed with extentions by `Normal Walsh <http://nwalsh.com/>`_ but it does not install the pages. See :ref:`Installation on Linux <install-linux>` for more information.

./ether
    Network specific source code that supports raw ethernet packets in a platform independent fashion using plugin modules. The principle feature is the ``channel`` data structure used to read and write raw ethernet packets using network features on GNU/Linux, with or without :program:`libpcap`, and on  *Windows* with :program:`WinPcap`. The source code in this folder is difficult to port cross-platform due to the way different operating systems implement their system header files and network stacks.

./plc
    The main source code for programs that communicate with Qualcomm Atheros powerline devices over Ethernet. The programs in this folder are essential programs for engineers and embedded software developers wanting to explore powerline device behavior. The Makefile in this folder will compile and install programs in :file:`/usr/local/bin` on GNU/Linux systems.

./mme
    A collection of helper functions dealing with HomePlug and Atheros management messages. They are not needed for proper toolkit operation but they can be useful during development and debugging because they print message content in readable format. Most of these functions require extra memory because they include symbol tables and extra data conversion functions.

./nodes
    A collection of functions that comrpise a generic,  light-weight XML parser. Atheros is currently exprimenting with various XML-based applications to support device management on embedded systems. These functions are the core. Currently, they are only used by the :ref:`pxe <program-pxe>` and :ref:`int6k2 <program-int6k2>` programs. See :ref:`XML Editing Functions <support-xml>` for more information.

./nvm
    Programs,  functions and make files related to Atheros NonVolatile Memory (NVM) files. All programs in this folder either read from or write to NVM files. None communicate with powerline devices. Some of the popular programs are `chknvm <chknvm.7.html>`_, `nvmsplit <nvmsplit.7.html>`_ and `nvmmerge <nvmmerge.7.html>`_.

./pib
    Programs, functions and make files related to Atheros Parameter Information Block (PIB) files. All programs in this folder either read from or write to PIB files. None communicate with powerline devices. Some of the popular programs are `chkpib <chkpib.7.html>`_, `modpib <modpib.7.html>`_, `getpib <getpib.7.html>`_ and `setpib <setpib.7.html>`_.

./serial
    Programs, functions and make files related to the Atheros Serial Communication Interface for Powerline devices. All of the programs in this folder communicate using a host serial port. None communicate with powerline devices over Ethernet. The main program of interest is `int6kuart <int6kuart.7.html>`_.

./scripts
    Miscellaneous shell scripts that call various programs in this package to perform tasks such as flashing a FW2.0 device. Care must be taken here to ensure that environment variables at the start of each script are appropriate for your system.

./ram
    Support modules for reading, printing and checking NVRAM and SDRAM configuration files. The :file:`.cfg` files in this folder have a different format than the :file:`.config` files released with the Atheros Windows :program:`Device Manager`. The files distributed with the Windows :program:`Device Manger` are 64 ASCII character with no checksum. The files in this directory are 32 binary bites with trailing checksum. Users may create new sdram configuration files by compiling :gh-src:`sdram.c <ram/sdram.c>`, using :command:`gcc -o sdram sdram.c` and running it without any command line arguments.

./tools
    Source code and header files used by virtually all programs in the toolkit. These files are generic and have application beyond this package. They provide GNU/Linux-style or POSIX-style functionality to programs running in environments that do not have either. They also implement operations like checksum computation and multi-byte hexadecimal encoding and decoding. See :ref:`Support Function Reference <support-functions>` for more information.

./VisualStudioNET
    Components unique to Microsoft Windows are kept in and under this folder. Specifically, it contains a *Visual Studio .NET* solution to compile most of the programs in this package using only Microsoft and WinPcap libraries. Compiled .exe files can be run on Windows enabled systems having :program:`WinPcap` installed. Adjustments may be necessary depending on your environment.
    Microsoft does not provide full POSIX support on Windows platforms. Consequently, alternative headers and libraries are included under this folder. For example, an abridged version of :gh-src:`unistd.h <VisualStudioNET/include/unistd.h>` and an alternative version of :gh-src:`stdint.h <VisualStudioNET/include/stdint.h>` are included under :file:`VisualStudioNET/include`. Other significant header files included here are :gh-src:`ethernet.h <VisualStudioNET/include/net/ethernet.h>`, :gh-src:`if_ether.h <VisualStudioNET/include/netinet/if_ether.h>` and :gh-src:`in.h <VisualStudioNET/include/netinet/in.h>`. Subfolder :file:`VisualStudio\\Library` contains *WinPcap* libraries. These folders are referenced in appropriate compiler and linker options for Microsoft Development environments.

Packages
========

The following table lists programs and the release packages that contains them. Packages contain programs of interest to various customer and engineering groups based on the activities that they normally perform. Some groups may need multiple packages. Some packages are restricted.

Program/Package Matrix
----------------------

The toolkit is divided into 5 groups loosely based on chipset family, intended audience, network security, intellectual property, code maturity and other criteria. Some individual programs may be hard to classify and so their placement may be subject to some debate.

amp-utils
    Tools developed for *INT6000*, *INT6300*, *INT6400* and *AR7400* chipsets.
    Some are obsolete but most are still useful.
    This package is a candidate for public distribution under a permissive open source license.

plc-utils
    Tools developed for *QCA6410*, *QCA7000* and *AR7420* chipsets.
    These tools handle the newer files formats, hardware boot conventsions and flash memory layouts for chipsets having fixed internal SRAM.
    This package is a candidate for public distribution under a permissive open source license.

nda-utils
    Tools designed to manipulate parameter blocks or access reserved or restricted features on powerline devices.
    Most are useful during powerline product development and production but are not needed for proper product operation or maintenance.
    This package is reserved for Qualcomm Atheros customers who sign a non-disclosure agreement covering Qualcomm Atheros intellectual property.
    Parts of this package are candidates for some sort of restrictive license.

key-utils
    Tools that generate HomePlug AV compliant keys from device MAC address or user passwords.
    This package is reserved for Qualcomm Atheros customers who sign a non-disclosure agreement related to Qualcomm Atheros powerline intellectual property.
    Parts of this package are candidates for some sort of restrictive license.

qca-utils
    Tools that perform restricted or experiemental operations on active powerline devices or parameter information blocks.
    Some of these tools here are one-of-a-kind or could present security risks to active powerline networks.
    This package not not released to customers. It is reserved for Qualcomm Atheros PLC Engineering use.
    Most of this package is a candidate for restrictive license.
