.SH NAME
mac2pw - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet Device Password Generator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR mac2pw
.RI [ options ] 
.IR address 
.RI [ address ]
[...] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
Print a range of consecutive Ethernet addresses and passwords on stdout.
The starting address and address range are specified.
Computed passwords consist of upper case letters (A-Z) with separators.
The algorithm used here is not required for HomePlug AV compliance and so vendors are free to use other methods to generate their own device passwords.

.PP
This program may be used to generate passwords for large numbers of consecutive device addresses over a fixed range.
It complements program \fBmac2pwd\fR which generates passwords for non-consecutive device addresses that may occur in unpredictable order.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH CAVEATS
Atheros provides this program as a simple means of generating unique and apparently random device passwords for a large volume of Ethernet devices.
It uses a Linear Congruential Random Number Generator to produce a single-wheel Bazerie Cylinder and to select characters from that cylinder.
The algorithm used is adequate for this purpose and nothing more.
Vendors are encouraged to develop their own means of generating passwords for the reasons mentioned below.

.PP
Device addresses can be determined using a variety of network management programs.
Anyone having access to this program, or the algorithm used, could compute the device password and gain access to device features reserved for privileged users.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBb\fR \fIbunch\fR
The password bunching factor.
Passwords have a fixed number of upper case letters broken into groups separated with dashes.
The number of letters in each group are the \fBbunch\fR value.
When \fIbunch\fR is \fB0\fR, password length is \fIcount\fR.
When \fIbunch\fR is \fB1\fR, password length is twice \fIcount\fR because every other character will be a dash.
The minimum is \fB0\fR and the maximum is \fB255\fR.
The default is \fB4\fR.

.TP
-\fBl \fIcount\fR
The number of letters in the password string.
Overall password length is the sum of \fIcount\fR plus the number of delimiters implied by \fIbunch\fR.
The minimum is \fB12\fR and the maximum is \fB64\fR.
The default is \fB16\fR.

.TP
-\fBn \fInumber\fR
The number of consecutive addresses and passwords to compute and print.
The minimum is \fB0\fR and the maximum is \fB1677215\fR or 0xFFFFFF.
The default is \fB1\fR.
In addition, \fInumber\fR cannot exceed the remaining available addresses in the \fIvendor\fR range.
For example, given start address 00:B0:52:FF:FF:00, there are only 255 remaining addresses in the 00:B0:52 vendor range so it would be an error to request more than that number.

.TP
.RB - q
Quiet mode.
Exclude the device address on output.
This option can be used in scripts to return the password associated with a given device address.

.TP
.RB - v
Verbose mode.
Prefix each line with a '0' column.
The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) uses the first column of a password database file to indicate which addresses and passwords have already been used.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ! ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fBaddress\fR
The first Ethernet address expressed as 12 consecutive hexadecimal digits.
Punctuation is not permitted.
The final address of the range is computed by adding \fBnumber\fR to this address.
This argument is required.
There is no default \fBaddress\fR.
If more than one device address is specified then an address/password series will be computed for each.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example prints the given device address and associated password string on stdout.

.PP
   # mac2pw 00B052000001
   00B052000001 MLPB-YLQM-YSSL-BMBB

.PP
This example does the same thing but omits the device address.

.PP
   # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
   MLPB-YLQM-YSSL-BMBB

.PP
The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords on stdout.
The starting device address is given and option \fB-n\fR specifies the number of addresses to print.
Output can be directed to a file.

.PP
   # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10

   00B05200000A KADM-CHII-KYVF-FQRZ

.PP
The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but starts from a different device address.
The address range here overlaps the range shown above but identical device addresses have identical passwords.

.PP
   # mac2pw 00B052000006 -n 10
   00B052000006 YPOS-UVDA-VMML-JBBP

.PP
The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but changes the password length and letter grouping.
Option \fB-l\fR specifies \fB12\fR letters and option \fB-b\fR specifies a bunching factor of three.
Use a bunching factor of \fB0\fR to remove dashes.

.PP
The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords but inserts a \fB0\fR at the start of each line to indicate that the address and password have not been used.
The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) will set the \fB0\fR to \fB1\fR after it programs a device.
This format is similar to PTS DBBuilder Utility output.
