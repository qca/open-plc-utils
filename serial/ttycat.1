.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy one or more files to a serial device.
This program is similar to traditional \fBcat\fR utility but expects stdout to be a serial tty device.
It will configure stdout before writing and will restore the original configuration afterwards.
It can be used to send data to the local Atheros UART-enabled powerline device.
If the remote powerline device is not UART-enabled, use program \fBedru\fR to capture and display arriving at the remote host and program \fBedsu\fR to send files in the opposite direction.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH COMMENTS
This program only supports the \fBLinux\fR and \fBMacOSX\fR  platforms, at present.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBs \fIspeed\fR
The serial baud rate.
Supported baud rates are \fB0\fR, \fB50\fR, \fB75\fR, \fB110\fR, \fB134\fR, \fB150\fR, \fB200\fR, \fB300\fR, \fB600\fR, \fB1200\fR, \fB1800\fR, \fB2400\fR, \fB4800\fR, \fB9600\fR, \fB19200\fR, \fB38400\fR, \fB57600\fR, \fB115200\fR, \fB230400\fR, \fB460800\fR, \fB500000\fR and \fB921600\fR.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of an input file.
No assumptions are made about the file based on the filename or extension.
Input files are not modified.

.TP
.IR stdout
The name of a serial output device.
A error will occur if the device is not a true tty device according as determined by the \fBisatty\fR function.
Depending on the amount of input data and the baud rate, serial output may take several seconds or several minutes.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command copies files \fBabc.txt\fR and \fBdef.bin\fR to stdout which must be an active serial device or an error will occur.

.PP
   # ttycat abc.txt def.bin > /dev/ttyUSB1
