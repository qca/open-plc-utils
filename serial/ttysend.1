.SH NAME
ttysend - Serial Line Rate Tester (Send)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR ttysend
.RI [ options ] 
.RI [< stdin ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Send data to a serial device.
The primary purpose of this program is to send data over a serial port that can then be received with the \fBttyrecv\fR utility.

.PP
The ttysend program exits when either one of the following conditions are met:
    1.
The file specified on the command line (see \fB-f\fR) is sent in its entirety.
    2.
The send time specified on the command line (see \fB-t\fR) has elapsed.

.PP
This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH COMMENTS
This program does not yet support Windows platforms.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBf \fIfile\fR
The file to send.
If this option is not specified, the values 0x00 to 0xFF are sent in a loop.
Instead of a filename, a '-' may be specified.
This is similar to the \fBtar\fR utility, and instructs ttysend to read from standard input.

.TP
-\fBl \fIfile\fR
The serial port file to send data to.
The default is \fB/dev/ttyS0\fR.

.TP
-\fBs \fIspeed\fR
The serial baud rate.
Supported baud rates are \fB0\fR, \fB50\fR, \fB75\fR, \fB110\fR, \fB134\fR, \fB150\fR, \fB200\fR, \fB300\fR, \fB600\fR, \fB1200\fR, \fB1800\fR, \fB2400\fR, \fB4800\fR, \fB9600\fR, \fB19200\fR, \fB38400\fR, \fB57600\fR, \fB115200\fR, \fB230400\fR, \fB460800\fR, \fB500000\fR and \fB921600\fR.

.TP
-\fBt \fItime\fR
Transmit for a maximum of \fBtime\fR seconds.
The default is 15 seconds.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- help
Print program help summary on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

.TP
.RB - ? ,-- version
Print program version information on stdout.
This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.
