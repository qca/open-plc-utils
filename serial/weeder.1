.SH NAME
weeder - Weeder Solid State Relay Module Controller 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR weeder
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ attenuation ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Set or get the attenuation level on the Qualcomm Atheros Production Test System using a local RS-232 communication port.
Attenuator settings are changed if an attenuation value is specified.
Attenuator settings are read and displayed if no attenuation value is specified.
The serial port settings must be configured before running this program.
Settings are 9600 baud, no parity, 8 data and 1 stop bit.
See datasheet \fIhttp://www.weedtech.com/wtssr-m.pdf\fR for more information.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-\fBe\fI echo\fR
Enable or disable echo mode.
The value of \fBecho\fR can be \fB1\fR=on or \fB0\fR=off.
Alternately, keywords "\fBon\fR" and "\fBoff\fR" can be used.
Atheros recommends that you always disable echo when using this program to speed relay switching.

.TP
-\fBm\fI mode\fR
Turn on or off the Device Under Test power.
The value of \fBmode\fR can be \fB1\fR=on or \fB0\fR=off.
Alternately, keywords "\fBon\fR" and "\fBoff\fR" can be used.

.TP
-\fBo\fI units\fR
Change relay control module order.
Individual relay control modules are assigned a digital address that can be referenced using the UTF-8 letters "[A-P]" then "[a-p]".
The Atheros PTS is configured so that module "B" is activated before module "A".
This options lets you specify some other module order.
The default value is "BA" to indicate "B" before "A".

.TP
-\fBp\fI port\fR
The name of the serial port.
On Linux, the name is usually "/dev/ttyS[0-4]".
On OS/X, the name is usually "/dev/cua[0-4]".
On Windows, the name is "com[0-9]:".
The default is "/dev/ttyS0" on Linux and "com1:" on Windows.
If environment string "\fBWEEDER\fR" is defined then it takes precedence over the default serial port.
This option then takes precedence over either default.
Belkin USB-to-serial cables are named "/dev/ttyUSB0" on Linux.

.TP
-\fBw\fI wait\fR
Wait time in milliseconds.
Serial I/O operation are slow and a delay is needed after each write operation.
Unfortunately, different operating systems require different wait times.
This options lets you adjust the time.
The default is 10 milliseconds which should be adequate on most systems.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR attenuation
The attenuation in decibels.
The attenuation may be expressed in decimal, binary or hexadecimal when setting attenuator but is displayed in decimal when reading the attenuator.
Binary values start with "0b" and hexadecimal values start with "0x".

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example turns the Device Under Test power on and configures the attenuator for \fB72\fRdb attenuation.
Option \fB-m\fR is not necessary if the Device Under Test power is already on.

.PP
   # weeder -m 1 72

.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB42\fRdb attenuation.
There is no needed to turn the Device Under Test on again because it remains on until turned off.

.PP
   # weeder 42

.PP
The next example configures the controller for \fB56\fRdb attenuation and turns the Device Under Test off.

.PP
   # weeder -m off 56

.PP
The next example displays the current attenuation on the console because no attenuation value was specified.

.PP
   # weeder
